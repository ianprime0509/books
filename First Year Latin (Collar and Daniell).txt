PREFACE

The book that is placed in the hands of a pupil during his first
year of the study of Latin should be simple and clear and
interesting in its treatment of the language; it should teach
with the utmost thoroughness those principles that it attempts to
teach, but it should not attempt to teach to-day what may be be
taught more properly to-morrow; it should get the pupil into the
reading of easy connected Latin as soon as possible, and for this
purpose should supply a generous amount of material graded to his
attainment; and it should never allow the pupil to leave the
classroom without a reminder of the extent to which Latin is a
part of his own language.

With these convictions the revision of Collar and Daniell's
"First Year Latin" was undertaken. All these principles underlay
the plan of "First Year Latin," but the unanimity with which they
have been accepted since the publication of that text has made it
possible in the revision so to extend their application as to
produce what is in effect a new book.

The vocabulary has been made briefer and more Cæsarian. From the
vocabularies of the lessons the pupil is asked to learn the
meanings of some five hundred and seventy words. About ninety per
cent of these words are included in the list of one thousand
words which Professor Lodge [1] suggests should be learned before
the end of the second year of the study of Latin. Over sixty per
cent occur more than ten times in Cæsar. In the Selections for
Reading the pupil has a chance to become acquainted casually with
a wider vocabulary.

A number of constructions which were taught in the original book
have been omitted. With three exceptions the constructions
included in the revision are those which Byrne [2] recommends for
the first year. Similarly, the pupil is no longer required to
learn uncommon forms which are not necessary for his second-year
reading.

Increased attention has been given to derivatives. Related
English words are often placed after the Latin words in the
vocabularies of the lessons as well as in the general vocabulary.
Everywhere in the reviews this important part of the study of
Latin is kept constantly before the pupil. Suggestions are
offered for the keeping of notebooks of English derivatives. The
force of certain common prefixes and suffixes in the formation
and meaning of Latin words is also explained.

Interspersed throughout the book there are ten Review Lessons,
which take up the words and constructions previously taught. The
machinery for drill has been further strengthened by a summary of
the uses of nouns and of verbs, and by review questions touching
upon the syntax, forms, derivatives, and principles of each
lesson. These questions have been placed after the Selections for
Reading, that they may be somewhat removed from the lessons they
concern.

The treatment of the Essentials of Grammar has been made more
useful by a comparison of English grammar with Latin grammar, and
by the inclusion of Latin equivalents for the English
illustrative words and phrases.

The material for reading has been somewhat changed, particularly
by the omission of the Fables and Stories, and by the
introduction of the Story of Perseus, of the simplified narrative
of Cæsar's Campaign against the Helvetians, and of a number of
pages from Eutropius. In all the selections the syntax has been
made to conform with that taught in the lessons, so that the
pupil may not be bothered or discouraged by unfamiliar
constructions.

As an aid to the pupil's pronunciation, a mark of accent has been
placed on the words in the vocabularies of the first eighteen
lessons, and on declensions and conjugations, both in the text
and in the Appendix.

Teachers who are familiar with "First Year Latin" will find that
none of its well-known excellences have been sacrificed in the
revision. There are, for example, the same short lessons, usually
less than two pages in length. In the exercises the sentences for
translation remain simple. Nowhere are many constructions brought
within the limits of a single sentence. The exercises for
translation from English into Latin are relatively shorter than
those from Latin into English. The order in which the verb is
developed and in which the various constructions are presented
will be found the same, with a few exceptions. In the study of
syntax the pupil is still led from the observation of model
sentences to the deduction of usages and principles. Passages of
connected Latin are introduced early and are of frequent
occurrence throughout the lessons, and there is ample material
for reading after the lessons have been completed. The content of
the book is still such that it is possible for high-school
classes to go through the lessons within thirty weeks.

The "Teacher's Manual," in addition to general directions and
notes on each lesson, contains carefully graded sentences for
sight reading and for the practice of the "direct method," as
well as material for drill on English derivatives of the Latin
words of the vocabularies.

It is hoped that teachers will find the numerous illustrations a
help to them in familiarizing pupils with the life of the Romans.
The four plates in colors were made especially for this book by
Mr. Arthur E. Becher after a careful study of all the phases of
Roman life that they represent. As for the other pictures, half
tones have been used where the subject could be made more
realistic if reproduced directly from a photograph. In cases
where line engravings seemed more suitable, drawings in the style
of the early Italian engravings were made for the purpose by Mr.
Thomas M. Cleland, Mr. W. A. Dwiggins, and Mr. Adrian J. Iorio.
As a whole the illustrations are believed to be of a quality
unexcelled in schoolbooks.

The reviser wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to the  the
suggestions received from Mr. Collar himself, who, before his
death, had given considerable thought to the aim and scope of the
revision. Indebtedness is also gratefully acknowledged to
Professor Charles Knapp, of Barnard College, New York; to Mr.
Herbert F. Hancox, of Lewis Institute, Chicago; and to Miss Grace
I. Bridge and Miss Grace E. Jackson, of the Hyde Park High
School, Chicago, for their helpful criticisms.

ESSENTIALS OF GRAMMAR

THE PARTS OF SPEECH

NOUNS

I. a. A _noun_ is the name of a person, place, or thing: _boy_,
_London_, _ship_; *puer*, *Londīnium*, *nāvis*.

b. A _proper noun_ is the name of a particular person, place, or
thing: _Cornelia_, _Rome_, _Rhone_; *Cornēlia*, *Rōma*,
*Rhodanus*.

c. A _common noun_ is a name that may be applied to any one of a
class of objects: _boy_, _city_, _day_; *puer*, *urbs*, *diēs*.

d. A _collective noun_ is a name that may be applied  to a group
of objects, though itself in the singular number (XXIII):
_crowd_, _family_; *multitūdō*, *gēns*.

e. A _verbal noun_ is the name of an action: _seeing_, _writing_,
_to see_, _to write_; *videndī* (459), *scrībendī*, *vidēre*,
*scrībere*.

f. An _abstract noun_ is the name of a quality or condition:
_goodness_, _truth_, _poverty_; *bonitās*, *vēritās*,
*paupertās*.

PRONOUNS

II. a. A _pronoun_ is a word used to take the place of a noun or
of another pronoun: _I_, _you_, _him_, _this_, _who_; *ego*,
*tū*, *eum*, *hoc*, *quī*.

b. The noun (or pronoun) for which a pronoun stands is called its
_antecedent_ (from *antecēdere*, _to go before_). Thus, in the
sentence _John goes to school, but he does not study_, the noun
_John_ is the antecedent of _he_. The antecedent is especially
common with a relative pronoun (II, d). Neither in Latin nor in
English does the antecedent necessarily stand in advance of its
pronoun: _What he says, he believes_, *quod dīcit, _id_ crēdit*.

c. A _personal pronoun_ shows by its form whether it stands (1)
for the speaker: _I_, _we_; *ego*, *nōs*, that is, the _first
person_; (2) for the person spoken to: _thou_, _you_; *tū*,
*vōs*, that is, the _second person_; or (3) for the person or
thing spoken of: _he_, _she_, _it_, _they_; *is*, *ea*, *id*,
*eī*, that is, the _third person_.

d. A _relative pronoun_ connects a subordinate clause, in which
it stands, with the antecedent: _The book *that* you have is
mine_, *liber _quem_ habēs meus est*. The relative pronouns in
English are _who_, _which_, _that_, and _as_; in Latin the
relative is *quī*.

e. An _interrogative pronoun_ is used to ask a question: _*Who*
is walking in the garden?_ *_Quis_ in hortō ambulat?* The
interrogative pronouns in English are _who_, _which_, and _what_;
in Latin, *quis* and *uter*.

f. A _demonstrative pronoun_ points out an object definitely:
_this_, _that_, _these_, _those_; *hic*, *ille*, *hī*, *illī*.

g. An _indefinite pronoun_ refers to an object indefinitely:
_some_, _some one_, _any_, _any one_; *aliquis*, *quis*.

h. A _reflexive pronoun refers back to the subject: _He blamed
*himself*_, *_sē_ culpāvit*.

ADJECTIVES

III. a. An _adjective_ is a word used to qualify or limit a noun
or a pronoun: _*good* book_, _*beautiful* moon_, _*five* girls_;
*liber _bonus_*, *lūna _pulchra_*, *_quīnque_ puellae*.

b. _A_, _an_, and _the_, really limiting adjectives, are
sometimes called _articles_. _The_ is the _definite article_, _a_
or _an_ the _indefinite article_. These articles are not used in
Latin.

c. _Numeral adjectives_ denote how many persons or things are
under consideration. They are either _cardinal_, denoting how
many: _one_, _two_, _three_, _four_; *ūnus*, *duo*, *trēs*,
*quattuor*; or _ordinal_, denoting which in order: _first_,
_second_, _third_, _fourth_; *prīmus*, *secundus*, *tertius*,
*quārtus*.

d. _Possessive adjectives_ denote ownership: _*my* friend_,
_*our* house_; *_meus_ amīcus*, *_nostra_ domus*. Possessive
adjectives are frequently used as possessive pronouns.

e. The demonstrative pronouns, the indefinite pronouns, and the
interrogative pronouns _which_ and _what_ may be used as
adjectives, and are then called respectively _demonstrative
adjectives_: _*this* book_, _*that* house_; *_hic_ liber*,
*_illa_ domus*; _indefinite adjectives_: _*some* boys_, *_aliquī_
puerī*; and _interrogative adjectives_: _*Which* way shall we
go?_ *_Quā_ viā ībimus?*

f. Adjectives are often used as nouns: "_The land of the
*free*_," *patria _līberōrum_*.

VERBS

IV. a. A _verb_ is a word which can declare or assert something
about a person, a place, or a thing: _The man *laughs*_, *vir
_rīdet_*; _the town *is captured*_, *oppidum _captum est_*; _the
leaf *falls*_, *folium _cadit_*.

b. A verb which has an object (XIV, a) to complete its meaning is
said to be _transitive_, or to be _used transitively_: _The girl
*has* a rose_, *puella rosam _habet_*.

c. A verb which does not have an object (XIV, a) to complete its
meaning is said to be _intransitive_, or to be _used
intransitively_: _Birds *fly*_, *avēs _volant_*; _I *walk*_,
*_abmulō_*.

NOTE. Thus certain verbs may at one time be transitive and at
another intransitive: _The wind *blew* the snow into our faces_;
_the wind *blew* furiously_.

d. Verbs are classified as _regular_ or _irregular_. This
distinction is made merely for convenience. A _regular verb_ in
English forms its imperfect (past) tense (XXXIII, a) and past
participle (XXXIV, b) by the addition of _d_ or _ed_ to the
present: present, _love_; past, _loved_; past participle,
_loved_. For Latin regular verbs see 658-662.

e. An _irregular verb_ in English does not form its imperfect
(past) tense by the addition of _d_ or _ed_ to the present:
present, _give_; past _gave_; past participle, _given_. For Latin
irregular verbs see 663-668.

f. An _auxiliary verb_ is used in the conjugation of other verbs:
_I *am* loved_, _he *has* given_. In Latin the verb *esse*, _to
be_ (663), is so used: *missus _est_*, _he has been sent_.

ADVERBS

V. a. An _adverb_ is used to modify a verb, an adjective, or
another adverb: _He walks *swiftly*_, *_celeriter_ ambulat*.

b. An _adverb_ of _place_ answers the question _where?_ --
_here_, _there_, _hence_; *hīc*, *illīc*, *hinc*.

c. An _adverb_ of _time_ answers the question _when?_ -- _then_,
_now_, _often_; *tum*, *nunc*, *saepe*.

d. An _adverb_ of _manner_ answers the question _how?_ -- _so_,
_well_, _ill_; *sīc*, *bene*, *male*.

e. An _adverb_ of _degree_ answers the question _how much?_ --
_little_, _almost_, _enough_; *paulō*, *paene*, *satis*.

f. A _modal adverb_ expresses affirmation or negations, or the
degree of confidence with which a statement is made: _yes_, _no_,
_certainly_, _perhaps_; *certē*, *fortisan*.

PREPOSITIONS

VI. A preposition is used before a noun or pronoun to show its
relation to another word in the sentence. Usually the relation
shown is position, direction, or time: _He sent a legion
*against* the enemy_, *_in_ hostēs legiōnem mīsit*. In Latin
certain phrases which would be introduced in English by a
preposition are expressed by the use of one of the cases (XXIV,
b) without a preposition: _*At dawn* he sent a legion_, *_prīmā
lūce_ legiōnem mīsit*.

CONJUNCTIONS

VII. a. A _conjunction_ connects words, phrases (XVI), clauses
(XX), and sentences (XVIII): _boys *and* girls_, *puerī _et_
puellae*; _they fought bravely *but* were conquered_, *fortiter
pugnāvērunt _sed_ victī sunt*.

b. A _coördinate conjunction_ connects words, phrases, clauses,
and sentences of equal order or rank. The conjunctions in the
examples in VII, a are coördinate.

c. A _subordinate conjunction_ connects a subordinate clause (XX,
a) with a principal clause (XX, a): _The boy was praised
*because* he was industrious_, *puer laudātus est _quod_ impiger
erat*.

INTERJECTIONS

VIII. An _interjection_ is used to express strong feeling. It is
not grammatically related to any other word in the sentence:
_oh!_ _ah!_ _alas!_ _hurrah!_ *ēheu!* *ecce!*

NOTE. The following couplets have often proved useful to young
persons in identifying the parts of speech:

    Three little words we often see Are Articles, _a_, _an_, and
    _the_.

    A Noun's the name of anything; As _school_ or _garden_,
    _hoop_ or _swing_.

    Adjectives tell the kind of noun; As _great_, _small_,
    _pretty_, _white_, or _brown_.

    Instead of nouns the Pronouns stand; _I_ come, _you_ go, as
    _they_ command.

    Verbs tell of something being done; As _read_, _write_,
    _spell_, _sing_, _jump_, or _run_.

    How things are done the Adverbs tell; As _slowly_, _quickly_,
    _ill_, or _well_.

    They also tell us where and when; As _here_ and _there_ and
    _now_ and _then_.

    A Preposition stands before A noun; as _in_ or _through_ a
    door.

    Conjunctions join the words together; As rain _and_ sunshine,
    wind _or_ weather.

    Conjunctions sentences unite; As kittens scratch _and_
    puppies bite.

    An Interjection shows surprise; As _Oh!_ how pretty! _Ah!_
    how wise!

THE SENTENCE

IX. A _sentence_ is a word or a group of words expressing a
thought: _Stars shine_; _he walks_; *stellae lūcent*; *ambulat*.

X. a. A _declarative sentence_ declares or asserts something:
_The farmers are plowing the fields_, *agricolae agrōs arant*.

b. An _interrogative sentence_ asks a question: _Why are the
farmers plowing the fields?_ *Cūr agricolae agrōs arant?*

c. An _imperative sentence_ expresses a command, a request, or an
entreaty: _Plow the fields to-day_, *hodiē agrōs arāte*.

d. An _exclamatory sentence_ expresses strong feeling or emotion:
_Would that he had remained!_ *Utinam mānsisset!*

XI. a. A sentence is made up of two parts, one called the
_subject_ and the other the _predicate_.

b. The _subject_ represents the person, place, or thing about
which something is declared or asserted: _*Birds* sing_, *_avēs_
cantant*.

c. The _predicate_ declares or asserts something about the
person, place, or thing which the subject represents: _Birds
*sing*_, *avēs _cantant_*.

NOTE. In English and in Latin either the subject or the
predicate, or both, may be enlarged to any extent by the addition
of qualifying words and expressions called modifiers: _*My
sister's small* birds_ | _sing *sweetly in the morning*_.

XII. The _simple subject_ is the noun or pronoun which signifies
the person, place, or thing about which the assertion is made.
The _simple predicate_ is the verb that makes the assertion.
_Birds_ is the simple subject, and _sing_ the simple predicate,
in the note under XI, c.

XIII. The _complete subject_ is the simple subject with all its
modifiers. The _complete predicate_ is the simple predicate with
all its modifiers. Thus, in the example in the note under XI, c
the complete subject is all that precedes the vertical line, and
the complete predicate all that follows it.

XIV. a. The _object_ of a verb is a word or an expression that
completes the meaning of the verb, and signifies that which is
affected by the action: _He sent *messengers*_, *_nūntiōs_
mīsit*; _he wished *me to go to italy*_, *_mē in Italiam īre_
voluit*.

b. The _direct object_ represents that which is immediately
affected by the action of the verb; the _indirect object_ that to
or for which the action is performed. Thus, in _He gave *me* a
*book*_, *_mihi librum_ dedit*, _book_ is the direct object, and
_me_ the indirect.

XV. a. A _predicate noun_ or a _predicate adjective_ is used
after certain intransitive or passive verbs to complete their
meaning, and to describe or define the subject: _Marcus is a
*sailor*_; _the sailor is *brave*_; *Mārcus _nauta_ est*; *nauta
_fortis_ est*.

b. The predicate noun or adjective is called the _complement_ of
the verb. Intransitive verbs that require a complement are called
_copulative verbs_. The verb _be_ (Latin *esse*) in its various
forms (_am_, _was_, _has been_, etc.) is often called the
_copula_.

c. The predicate noun or adjective has the same case as the
subject; hence the term _predicate nominative_.

XVI. a. A _phrase_ is a combination of words (not subject and
predicate) used as a single part of speech.

b. An _adjective phrase_ modifies a noun: _A man *of great
valor*_, *vir _magnae virtūtis_*.

c. An _adverbial phrase_ modifies a verb: _They work *with great
diligence*_, *_magnā cum diligentiā_ labōrant*. In Latin certain
cases of nouns are used to express what in English would be
prepositional phrases of an adverbial nature (VI).

XVII. A _simple sentence_ contains but one statement, that is,
one subject and one predicate: _Cæsar drew up a line of battle_,
*Caesar aciem īnstrūxit*.

XVIII. A _compound sentence_ contains two or more independent
statements: _Cæsar drew up a line of battle, but the enemy fled_,
*Caesar aciem īnstrūxit, sed hostēs fūgērunt*.

NOTE. An independent statement is one that can stand alone; it
does not depend on (qualify or limit) another statement.

XIX. A _complex sentence_ contains one independent (principal)
statement and one or more dependent (subordinate) statements:
_When the messenger had replied, the lieutenant spoke as
follows_, *cum nūntius respondisset, lēgātus haec dīxit*.

NOTE. A dependent, or subordiate, statement is one that qualifies
or limits another in some way; thus, the dependent statement
_when the messenger had replied_ limits the verb _spoke_, telling
when the lieutenant spoke.

XX. a. The separate statements in a compound or a complex
sentence are called _clauses_, and, as has already been seen,
they may be either _independent_ (_principal_) or _dependent_
(_subordinate_).

b. When dependent (subordinate) clauses modify nouns or pronouns
they are called _adjective clauses_: _The girls *whom we praised*
were good_, *puellae _quās laudāvimus_ bonae erant*.

c. When dependent (subordinate) clauses modify verbs they are
called _adverbial clauses_: _*When the messenger had replied,*
the lietenant spoke as follows_, *_cum nūntius respondisset,_
lēgātus haec dīxit*.

d. When dependent (subordinate) clauses are used as nouns they
are called _substandtive clauses_: _*That you are here* pleases
us_, *_quod ades_ nōs dēlectat*.

e. Dependent (subordinate) clauses introduced by _when_ (Latin
*cum*, *ubi*, etc.) are called _temporal clauses_; introduced by
_because_ (Latin *quod* etc.), they are called _causal clauses_;
introduced by _if_ (Latin *sī*), they are called _conditional
clauses_; introduced by _although_ (Latin *cum*, *etsī*, etc.),
they are called _concessive clauses_; introduced by a relative
pronoun (Latin *quī*), they are called _relative clauses_.

f. The independent clause of a complex sentence is called the
_principal clause_. Connected clauses that are of the same rank,
both independent or both dependent, are said to be _coördinate_.

INFLECTION

XXI. _Inflection_ is a change in the form of a word to indicate a
change in its meaning or use: _man_, _men_, _boy_, _boy's_,
_love_, _loved_; *vir*, *virī*, *puer*, *puerī*, *amant*,
*amābant*.

DECLENSION

XXII. The inflection of a noun or pronoun is called its
_declension_. Nouns and pronouns in English are declined to show
number and case, and a few nouns to show gender. In Latin the
nouns and pronouns are declined; adjectives also are declined in
gender, number, and case to agree with the nouns which they
modify.

_Number_

XXIII. A noun or pronoun is in the _singular number_ when it
means one person, place, or thing: _town_, _city_, _I_;
*oppidum*, *urbs*, *ego*; in the _plural number_ when it means
more than one person, place, or thing: _towns_, _cities_, _we_;
*oppida*, *urbēs*, *nōs*.

_Case_

XXIV. a. The several forms taken by words that are declined are
called _cases_. In English there are the following cases, to
indicate the uses of nouns and pronouns:

1. The _nominative_, primarily used as the subject of a sentence:
_*He* throws the ball_.

2. The _possessive_ (genitive), used to denote possession or
ownership: _John throws *his* ball_; _see the *queen's* crown_.

3. The _objective_ (accusative), used as the object of a
transitive verb or of a preposition: _John throws the *ball* to
*him*_.

4. The _dative_, used to express the indirect object of the verb:
_John throws *him* the ball_. Only personal pronouns and the
pronoun _who_ have separate forms for these cases in English.

Nouns have the nominative, objective, and dative alike, with a
separate form for the possessive.

b. In Latin there are seven cases: _nominative_, _genitive_,
_dative_, _accusative_, _ablative_, _vocative_, and _locative_;
but a single form sometimes does duty for several cases (cf.
*agricola*, 63). The nominiative, genitive, and accusative cases
are used much like the same cases in English. The dative
expresses in general that relation of words to other words which
is expressed in English by prepositional phrases beginning with
_to_ or _for_: _to the farmer_, _for the man_. The ablative
expresses in general that relation of words to other words which
is expressed in English by prepositional phrases beginning with
_from_, _with_, _by_, _in_: _with a spear_, _by a story_.

c. The direct object of a verb in Latin is the accusative case,
but sometimes the direct object in English is expressed in Latin
by he dative (425, 433).

_Gender_

XXV. a. The gender of English nouns is what is called _natural
gender_, and hence has very little to do with grammar. Thus, a
noun denoting a male is in the _masculine gender_: _man_, _boy_,
_father_; a noun denoting a female is in the _feminine gender_:
_woman_, _girl_, _mother_; one denoting either male or female is
in the _common gender_: _cat_, _dog_, _parent_; one denoting a
sexless object is in the _neuter gender_: _river_, _wind_,
_mountain_.

b. In Latin only nouns that denote persons and some animals have
natural gender: *nauta*, _sailor_ (masc.); *māter*, _mother_
(fem.). All others have an arbitrary gender, called _grammatical
gender_, determined chiefly by the ending: *flūmen*, _river_
(neut.); *ventus*, _wind_ (masc.); *nūbēs*, _cloud_ (fem.).

COMPARISON

XXVI. a. English adjectives and adverbs are inflected to show
degree. This is called _comparison_. There are three degrees of
comparison, the _positive_, the _comparative_, and the
_superlative_: positive _wise_, comparative _wiser_, superlative
_wisest_; positive _good_, comparative _better_, superlative
_best_; positive _often_, comparative _oftener_, superlative
_oftenest_.

b. Adjectives and adverbs are also compared in English by
prefixing the adverbs _more_ and _most_: _beautiful_, _more
beautiful_, _most beautiful_.

c. Comparison in Latin is indicated exactly as in English:
*sapiēns*, *sapientior*, *sapientissimus*; *bonus*, *melior*,
*optimus*; *idōneus*, *magis idōneus*, *maximē idōneus*; *saepe*,
*saepis*, *saepissimē*.

CONJUGATION

XXVII. a. The inflection of a verb is called _conjugation_. Verbs
are conujugated to show voice, mood, and tense, and the number
and person of the subject.

b. The English verb has but few changes of form. Thus the verb
_love_ has in common use only the forms _love_, _loves_,
_loving_, and _loved_. Most of the conjugation of the verb is
made up of verb phrases formed by the use of auxiliaries (IV, f):
_I am loved_, _I shall love_, _I shall have been loved_, etc.

c. The Latin verb has many changes in form to show voice, mood,
tense, number, and person: *amor*, _I am loved_; *amābō*, _I
shall love_; *amātus erō*, _I shall have been loved_.

_Voice_

XXVIII. A verb is in the _active voice_ when it represents the
subject as acting (or being): _The man *praised* the boy_, *vir
puerum _laudāvit_*. A verb is in the _passive voice_ when it
represents the subject as acted on: _The boy *was praised* by the
man_, *puer ā virō _laudātus est_*.

_Mood_

XXIX. A verb is in the _indicative mood_ when it is used in
stating a fact or in asking a question: _The citizens *are
assembling*_, *cīvēs _conveniunt_*; _why *do* they *carry* arms?_
*cūr arma _portant_?*

XXX. a. In English a verb is in the _subjunctive mood_ when it
asserts something doubtfully or conditionally. It is used in
subordinate clauses, and is usually introduced by _if_, _though_,
and the like: _If he *were* here, I should be glad_; _"Though he
*slay* me, yet will I trust in him."_

NOTE. The subjunctive is very little used in modern English, its
place being taken by the indicative.

b. In Latin the subjunctive has a great variety of uses, in
independent as well as in dependent clauses (344, 358, 373,
etc.).

XXXI. a. A verb is in the _imperative mood_ when it expresses
command, request, or entreaty: _*Fortify* the city_, *urbem
_mūnīte_*.

b. Unless emphatic the subject of the imperative (_thou_ or
_you_) is not expressed either in English or in Latin.

_The Infinitive_

XXXII. a. The _infinitive_ in English (_to love_, _to have
loved_, etc.) is a verbal noun. It has neither person nor number.
Like a noun it may be the subject or the object or the complement
of a verb: _*To see* is *to believe*_; _he wishes *to go* home_.
Like a verb it may have a subject, an object, and adverbial
modifiers: _We wish *you* to being your *work early*_.

b. The Latin infinitive is used in the same way that the English
infinitive is used. It differs, however, from the English
infinitive in not being used in prose in expressions of purpose
(_They came *to see* me), and in being used constantly for the
verb of a statement that is given indirectly: _He said that *he
would come*_, *dīxit _se ventūrum esse_*.

c. The verbal noun in _-ing_ is sometimes called an infinitive:
_*Seeing* is *believing*_ = _to see is to believe_. This verbal
noun has its counterpart in the Latin gerund (459).

_Tense_

XXXIII. a. A verb is in the _present_, _past_ (_imperfect_), or
_future_ tense according as it represents an action as taking
place in present, past, or future time: _I love_, _I loved (was
loving)_, _I shall love_; *amō*, *amābam*, *amābō*.

b. The _present perfect_ (_perfect_) tense represents an action
completed in the present: _I have loved_, *amāvī*; the _past
perfect_ (_pluperfect_) an action completed in the past before
some other past action or state: _I had loved_, *amāveram*; and
the _future perfect_ an action completed in the future before
some other future action or state: _I shall have loved_,
*amāverō*.

_The Participle_

XXXIV. a. The _participle_ is a verbal adjective. Like an
adjective it may qualify a noun: _*struggling* soldiers_,
*mīlitēs _labōrantēs*. Like a verb it may have an object and
adverbial modifiers: _Fearing *danger* they remained in the
camp_, *_perīculum_ veritī in castrīs mānsērunt*.

b. There are in English three participles in the active voice:
present, _loving_; past, _loved_; perfect, _having loved_; and
three in the passive voice: present, _(being) loved_; past,
_loved_; perfect, _having been loved_. In Latin the past and
perfect active and the present passive participles are wanting,
but there is a future participle.

c. The participle in _-ing_ is used with the auxiliary _be_ to
make the progressive form of the verb: _you *are loving*_, _he
*was loving*_, _they *will be loving*_. Latin has no special
tenses for the progressive forms.



TO THE BEGINNER IN LATIN

*What Latin is.* Latin is the language that was used by the
ancient Romans. It gets its name from the _Lati'ni_, a little
tribe living in western Italy more than twenty-five hundred years
ago. The Latini, and their successors, the Romans, slowly
extended their lands and their power until they gained control of
all Italy, and finally of all the civilized world of those days.
Their dominions reached from the Atlantic Ocean to Persia and
from the Baltic Sea to the deserts of Africa, and their language
was spoken wherever they ruled. For about six hundred years the
Romans were the most powerful nation on the earth. Their history
covers in all a period of twelve centuries; no nation has had a
longer history.

*Why Latin is studied.* And now why is it that it is worth your
while to study a language that is so many centuries old?

First, a knowledge of Latin helps you to use English more
correctly. As more than half the words in the English language
are of Latin origin, you yourself in a sense speak Latin to-day.
There are the words of your everyday talk, like _animal_; there
are the learned words, like _emancipate_; there are the terms of
law, of medicine, and of the sciences, like _mandamus_,
_delirium_, and _antennae_; and there are the words which are
newly come into use, like _tractor_. If you study Latin, you will
be helped to know the meaning of many of these words, how to
spell them, and how to use them correctly; all of which is quite
worth your while, particularly if you are intending to enter one
of the professions.

Again, the study of Latin will train you mind. Latin is somewhat
unlike English in the form of its words and much unlike English
in the order of words in its sentences. You will therefore be
obliged to look carefully, and to think carefully, and to speak
carefully whenever you try to read and to translate anything
written in Latin. But this close attention will do good to your
mind: it will train you powers of observation, of clear thinking,
and of clear expression; in fact, no other subject that you study
in school can do as much for you as can Latin toward developing
these desirable powers.

Furthermore, the reading of Latin will add to your information.
If you are to be a well-informed person, you will need to know
something about Rome and the Romans, and what they have meant in
the history of the world; and in no other way can you better come
to know and to appreciate the literature, the life, the customs,
and the civilization of the Romans than by the faithful study of
their language and of the things written in that language.

*How to study Latin.* 1. Never allow yourself to think that Latin
is not worth your best efforts or that it is too hard for you.
Industry and confidence will bring you success in this study.

2. Have a fixed hour each day for the study of your Latin. If
possible, prepare your lesson for to-morrow immediately after
reciting the lesson of to-day. Your interest will then be greater
and your mind better fitted to grasp the subject.

3. Learn each day's lesson with thoroughness. Neglect no part of
the lesson even if it seems to you unimportant.

4. Before beginning a new lesson recall what you have already
learned about the subject to be taught in the new lesson. For
example, if you are about to study a new use of one of the cases,
recall all the uses of that case which you have previously
learned.

5. Review the vocabularies regularly. A knowledge of the meanings
of the words will be a great saving of time to you, as well as a
constant encouragement. Aim to know every word you have met, and
to this end keep lists of words about the meaning of which you
are doubtful.

6. Recite the declensions and the conjugations by yourself aloud.
It will help you to remember them, and you will make better
recitations. Read the Latin sentences aloud each day.

7. Go over the new lesson slowly, and thus avoid mistakes in the
spelling of words, in their endings, and in the explanation of
Latin constructions.

8. Recall your English grammar when you are learning Latin
constructions; most of the Latin usages that you will learn in
your first year are like English usages.

9. Study the lessons as a whole. Then go back to special
difficulties. Go over the lesson again just before the recitation
and consider the troublesome parts.



INTRODUCTION

ALPHABET

1. The Latin alphabet has no _j_ or _w_. Otherwise it is the same
as the English.

2. The vowels are *a*, *e*, *i*, *o*, *u*. The other letters are
consonants.

3. The letter *i* is used both as a vowel and as a consonant.
Before a vowel in the same syllable it has the force of a
consonant and is called *i*-_consonant_. Thus in *iaciō*, _I
throw_, the first *i* is a consonant, and the second a vowel.

SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS [1]

4. The vowels are either long or short. In this book the long
vowels are marked (-); unmarked vowels are to be regarded as
short. The vowels are sounded as follows:

    *ā* like the last _a_ in _aha'_
    *ă* like the first _a_ in _aha'_
    *ē* like _e_ in _they_
    *ĕ* like _e_ in _met_
    *ī* like _i_ in _machine_
    *ĭ* like _i_ in _pin_
    *ō* like _o_ in _note_
    *ŏ* like _o_ in _obey_
    *ū* like _oo_ in _boot_
    *ŭ* like _oo_ in _foot_

5. The diphthongs are sounded as follows:

    *ae* like _ai_ in _aisle_
    *au* like _ou_ in _our_
    *ei* like _ei_ in _eight_
    *eu* like _eu_ in _feud_
    *oe* like _oi_ in _boil_
    *ui* like _we_

6. The consonants generally have the same sound as the
corresponding consonants in English. But there are the following
exceptions:

    *c* is like _c_ in _come_
    *g* is like _g_ in _get_
    *i-consonant* is like _y_ in _yet_
    *s* is like _s_ in _sun_
    *t* is like _t_ in _time_
    *v* is like _w_ in _wine_
    *x* is like _x_ in _extra_
    *bs* and *bt* are like _ps_ and _pt_
    *ch* is like _k_ in _kite_
    *gu*, *qu*, and sometimes *su* before a vowel are like _gw_,
      _qw_, and _sw_ (_u_ is not counted as a vowel)
    *ph* is like _p_
    *th* is like _t_

When a consonant is doubled (as *ll*), it should be pronounced
twice.

quis, sē. 24. mē, tē. 25 gēns, sīc. 26. vel, vir, iam.

SYLLABLES

8. A syllable consists of a vowel or a diphthong with or without
one or more consonants. Hence a word has as many syllables as it
has vowels and diphthongs: *ō-ce'-a-nus*, _ocean_.

9. When a word is divided into syllables, a single consonant
between two vowels is joined with the vowel following:
*lā-ti-tū'-dō*, _width_.

10. If there are two or more consonants between two vowels, the
first is pronounced with the preceding vowel: *im-mor-tā'-lis*,
_immortal_.

But a consonant followed by *l* or *r* is pronounced with the *l*
or *r*, except in *ll* and *rr*: *pū'-bli-cus*, _public_; when
*ll* or *rr* occurs, one *l* or one *r* is joined to the
preceding syllable, and the other to the following syllable:
*ter'-ra*, _land_.

Compound words are divided in such a way as to show the component
parts: *ab'-est* (*ab*, _away_, + *est*, _he is_), _he is away_.

11. The last syllable of a word is called the _ultima_; the one
next to the last, the _penult_; the one before the penult, the
_antepenult_.

12. A vowel is generally short before another vowel or *h*:
*pŏ-ē'-ma*, _poem_; *nĭ'-hil*, _nothing_.

13. A vowel is generally short before *nt* or *nd*, and before
final *m* or final *t*: *vo'-cănt*, _they call_; *vo-cā'-băm*, _I
was calling_.

14. A vowel is long before *nf* or *ns*: *a'-māns*, _loving_.

15. A vowel resulting from the contraction of two vowels is long:
*cō'-gō* (*co-agō*), _I bring together_.

16. The quantity of vowels other than those mentioned in the
preceding sections must be learned by observation.

QUANTITY OF SYLLABLES

17. A syllable is _long by nature_ when it contains a long vowel
or a diphthong: *vic-tō'-ri-a*, _victory_; *prae'-mi-um*,
_reward_.

18. A syllables is _short by nature_ when it does not contain a
long vowel or a diphthong: *o-pī'-ni-ō*, _opinion_.

19. A syllable is _long by position_ when it has a short vowel
followed by *x* or *z*, or by two or more consonants, unless
these two consonants are *p*, *b*, *t*, *d*, *c*, *g*, followed
by *l* or *r*; but the short vowel is still pronounced short:
*dē-trī-men'-tum*, _loss_.

ACCENT

20. Words of two syllables have the accent on the first syllable:
*pa'-ter*, _father_.

21. Words of more than two syllables have the accent on the
penult when it is long, otherwise on the antepenult:
*dē-mōn-strā'-re*, _to point out_; *ce-le'-ri-tās*, _swiftness_;
*ē-ven'-tus*, _outcome_ (cf. 19).

22. Several words, of which the commonest are *-ne*, the sign of
a question, and *-que*, _and_, are appended to other words. The
words so appended are known as enclitics. The words to which they
are appended are accented on the syllable preceding the enclitic,
whether that syllable is long or short: *a-mat'-ne?* _does he
love?_ *ar-mă-que*, _and arms_.

EXERCISE IN ACCENT AND PRONUNCIATION

23. Divide the following words into syllables, state the rule for
the accent, and then pronounce:

  1. dīvidunt, appellāre
  2. īnstitūtis, differēbāmus
  3. hūmānitāte, prōvinciā
  4. longus, animōs
  5. importābunt, bellum
  6. causīs, praecēdō
  7. fīnis, prohibitus
  8. initiō, persuāserāmus
  9. tempora, magistrātuum
  10. frāternus, conloquium

24. The following Latin version of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little
Star" may be used for practice in pronunciation, and for
illustration of the preceding statements about syllables, accent,
etc.:

  MICĀ, MICĀ

  Micā, micā, parva stella!
  Mīror quaenam sīs, tam bella!
  Splendēns ēminus in illō,
  Alba velut gemma, caelō.

  Quandō fervēns Sōl discessit,
  Nec calōre prāta pāscit,
  Mox ostendis lūmen pūrum,
  Micāns, micāns per obscūrum.

  Tibi noctū quī vagātur
  Ob scintillulam grātātur;
  Nī micārēs tū, nōn scīret
  Quās per viās errāns īret.

  Meum saepe thalamum lūce
  Speculāris cūriōsā;
  Neque carpseris sopōrem
  Dōnec vēnit Sōl per auram.

[1] Latin is pronounced to-day substantially as it was pronounced
by the Romans at the beginning of the Christian era.



LESSON I

THE SINGULAR AND PLURAL OF NOUNS AND VERBS

THE NOMINATIVE CASE USED AS SUBJECT

25. *The Singular and Plural of Nouns and Verbs.*

  NOUN
  _Nom. Sing._ agricol*a*, _farmer_
  _Nom. Plur._ acricol*ae*, _farmers_

  VERB
  _3d Pers. Sing._ labōra*t*, _works_, _is working_, _does work_
  _3d Pers. Plur._ labōra*nt*, _work_, _are working_, _do work_

a. Observe that the distinction between the singular and the
plural is shown by the final letters of the noun and of the verb.
These final letters of a noun are called _case endings_; the
final letters of a verb are called _personal endings_.

b. Form the nominative plural of the nouns in the vocabulary, and
the third person plural of the verbs.

26. VOCABULARY

  *agri'cola*, farmer (_agriculture_)
  *Cornē'lia*, Cornelia
  *Iū'lia*, Julia
  *nau'ta*, sailor (_nautical_)
  *puel'la*, girl
  *et*, _conj._, and
  *-ne*, _enclitic, sign of a question_
  *am'bulat*, walks (_perambulate_)
  *appropin'quat*, approaches, draws near (_propinquity_)
  *can'tat*, sings (_incantation_)
  *labō'rat*, works, labors, suffers (laboratory)
  *na'tat*, swims (_natatorium_)
  *quis*, _interrog. pron._, who?
  *quid*, _interrog. pron._, what?

27. *The Nominative Case used as Subject.*

  1. *Puella cantat*, _the girl sings (is singing, does sing)._
  2. *Puellae cantant*, _the girls sing (are singing, do sing)._
  3. *Cantatne puella*, _does the girl sing (is the girl singing)?_
  4. *Cantantne puellae*, _do the girls sing (are the girls singing)?_

a. In Latin there is no article (III, b): *puella* may be
translated _girl_, _a girl_, or _the girl_; and *puellae*,
_girls_ or _the girls_.

b. What is the subject (XI, b) of each of the model sentences,
and what is the predicate (XI, c)? In what case is the subject of
a Latin verb (XXIV)?

c. Observe that the verbs agree with their subjects in number.

d. Observe that *-ne* is not separately translated. Usually it is
attached to the emphatic word in the sentence, and the emphasized
word is placed first. When an interrogative word is used, *-ne*
is omitted: see sentence 11 below. In English *-ne* is
represented on the printed page by the question mark, and in oral
translation by the inflection of the voice.

28. _*Rule for the Nominative Case as Subject.* The subject of a
verb is in the nominative case._

29. _*Rule for the agreement of the Verb with its Subject.* A
verb agrees with its subject in person and number._

EXERCISES

30. 1. Nauta cantat. 2. Nautae cantant. 3. Agricola labōrat. 4.
Agricolae labōrant. 5. Puella natat. 6. Puellae natant. 7.

approaches? 4. Are the sailors approaching? 5. Does Cornelia
sing? 6. Cornelia and Julia are walking and singing. 7. The girl
sings, and the farmer works. 8. Sailors and farmers are working.

LESSON II

THE ACCUSATIVE CASE USED AS THE DIRECT OBJECT

32. *The Accusative Case used as the Direct Object.*

  1. *Nauta puellam vocat*, _the sailor calls the girl._
  2. *nautae puellās vocant*, _the sailors call the girls._

a. Observe that *puellam* is the object (XIV, a) of *vocat*, and
*puellās* of *vocant*; and that when a Latin noun is used as the
object, the case ending is not the same as when it is the subject
and so in the nominative. The case of the object in Latin is
called _accusative_ (XXIV) and not objective, as in English.

b. Form the accusative singular and plural of the nouns in
sections 26 and 34.

33. _*Rule for the Accusative as the Direct Object.* The object
of a verb is in the accusative case._

34. VOCABULARY

  *a'qua*, water (_aquatic_)
  *Gal'ba*, Galba
  *lit'tera*, letter (of the alphabet); _plur._ a letter,
    epistle (_literary_)
  *ter'ra*, land (_terrace_)
  *tu'ba*, trumpet (_tuba_)
  *a'mat*, loves, likes (_amateur_)
  *con'vocat*, calls together (_convoke_)
  *ha'bet*, has, holds (_habit_)
  *lau'dat*, praises (_laud_)
  *vi'det*, sees (_provide_)
  *quem*, _acc. of *quis*_, whom?
  *quid*, _acc. of *quid*_, what?
  *nunc*, _adv._, now

35. *Order of words.* Observe that in the model sentences (32)
the order of Latin words is unlike the order of the words in the
English sentences. The normal position of the subject of a Latin
sentence is at the beginning; that of the verb is at the end.
Variations from this order put emphasis on the word moved toward
the beginning of the sentence; thus, *puellam nauta vocat* means
that the sailor calls _a girl_. In translating Latin sentences
put the emphasis where it belongs.

LESSON III

THE PRESENT INDICATIVE ACTIVE OF THE FIRST CONJUGATION

38. *The Four Conjucations.* Regular verbs in Latin are divided
into four classes, or conjucations (XXVII), distinguished from
one another by the stem vowel before the ending *-re* of the
present infinitive active.

                  PRESENT         PRESENT         DISTINGUISHING
                  INFINITIVE      STEM            VOWEL
  _First Conj._   amā're          amā-            *ā*
  _Second Conj._  monē're         monē-           *ē*
  _Third Conj._   re'gere         rege-           *ĕ*
  _Fourth Conj._  audī're         audī-           *ī*

39. *The Present Indicative Active of the First Conjugation.*

                SINGULAR                                   PERSONAL ENDINGS
  _1st Pers._   a'm*ō*,                                    *-ō*,
                _I love, am loving, do love_               _I_
  _2d Pers._    a'mā*s*,                                   *-s*,
                _you love, are loving, do love_            _you_
  _3d Pers._    a'ma*t*,                                   *-t*,
                _he, she, it loves, is loving, does love_  _he_, _she_, _it_

                PLURAL
  _1st Pers._   amā'*mus*,                                 *-mus*,
                _we love, are loving, do love_             _we_
  _2d Pers._    amā'*tis*,                                 *-tis*,
                _you love, are loving, do love_            _you_
  _3d Pers._    a'ma*nt*,                                  *-nt*,
                _they love, are loving, do love_           _they_

a. Observe that in *amō* the final *a* of the stem disappears,
giving *amō* instead of *amaō*. In what forms is this *a* of the
stem not long (13)?

b. When the subject of a verb is a personal pronoun, it is seldom
expressed in Latin unless emphatic. Why is the omission of the
subject possible? Translate *puellās convocātis* and *nautam
vident*.

c. Inflect like *amō* the present indicative active of *ambulō*,
*appropinquō*, *cantō*, *convocō*, labōrō*, *laudō*, and *natō*.

40. VOCABULARY

  *dō*, _pres. stem *dă-* (the *a* of *dō* is regularly short,
    but long in *dās*), give (_dative_)
  *in'cola*, inhabitant
  *sae'pe*, _adv._, often
  *sed*, _conj._, but
  *spec'tō*, _pres. stem *spectā-*_, look at (_spectator_)

LESSON IV

THE GENITIVE CASE USED TO DENOTE POSSESSION

43. *The Genitive Case used to denote Posession*

  1. *Fīliae Galbae cantant*, _the daughters of Galba sing_, or
     _Galba's daughters sing_
  2. *Fīliās nautārum laudāmus*, _we praise the daughters of the
     sailors_, or _we praise the sailors' daughters_.

a. Observe that *Galbae* modifies *fīliae* and tells whose
daughters are singing. In the same way *nautārum* modifies
*fīliās* and tells whose daughters we are praising. This usage of
*Galbae* and of *nautārum* is like that of the English possessive
case (XXIV, a, 2). In Latin the case thus used is called the
_genitive_ (XXIV, b), and this usage of that case is called the
_Genitive of Possession_.

b. Observe the case endings of the genitive. Form the genitive
singular and the genitive plural of the nouns in sections 26, 34,
and 45.

c. Note the translations given to the genitives in the model
sentences. Translate *fīlia agricolae* and *fīliae agricolārum*.

d. The genitive normally stands after the word it modifies.

44. _*Rule for the Genitive of Possession.* The word denoting the
owner or possessor is in the genitive case._

45. VOCABULARY

  *fē'mina*, woman (_feminine_)
  *fī'lia*, daughter (_filial_)
  *fortū'na*, fortune (_fortunate_)
  *poē'ta*, poet (_poetic_)
  *rēgī'na*, queen
  *cu'ius*, _gen. of *quis* and of *quid*_, of whom? whose? of
    what?
  *dēlec'tō*, _pres. stem *dēlectā-*_, delight, please
    (_delectable_)
  *exspec'tō*, _pres. stem *exspectā-*, wait, wait for (_expect_)
  *fu'gō*, _pres. stem *fugā-*_, put to flight, rout
  *lī'berō*, _pres. stem *līberā-*_, set free, free (_liberate_)
  *por'tō*, _pres. stem *portā-*_, carry, bring (_portable_)
  *et'iam*, _adv._, even
