Italics are represented using _underscores_ and boldface using *asterisks*.
Italics used in list item headings are not preserved (otherwise sub-lists would
be numbered _a_, _b_, and so forth, which introduces unnecessary clutter to the
document).

Small caps have been rendered using all uppercase letters.

The footnotes have been renumbered so that all footnotes can be given at the end
of the chapter.

The formatting of lists and such is not always exactly the same as in the
original: an attempt has been made to keep the spacing relatively uniform.

PREFACE

The book that is placed in the hands of a pupil during his first year of the
study of Latin should be simple and clear and interesting in its treatment of
the language; it should teach with the utmost thoroughness those principles that
it attempts to teach, but it should not attempt to teach to-day what may be be
taught more properly to-morrow; it should get the pupil into the reading of easy
connected Latin as soon as possible, and for this purpose should supply a
generous amount of material graded to his attainment; and it should never allow
the pupil to leave the classroom without a reminder of the extent to which Latin
is a part of his own language.

With these convictions the revision of Collar and Daniell's "First Year Latin"
was undertaken. All these principles underlay the plan of "First Year Latin,"
but the unanimity with which they have been accepted since the publication of
that text has made it possible in the revision so to extend their application as
to produce what is in effect a new book.

The vocabulary has been made briefer and more Cæsarian. From the vocabularies of
the lessons the pupil is asked to learn the meanings of some five hundred and
seventy words. About ninety per cent of these words are included in the list of
one thousand words which Professor Lodge [1] suggests should be learned before
the end of the second year of the study of Latin. Over sixty per cent occur more
than ten times in Cæsar. In the Selections for Reading the pupil has a chance to
become acquainted casually with a wider vocabulary.

A number of constructions which were taught in the original book have been
omitted. With three exceptions the constructions included in the revision are
those which Byrne [2] recommends for the first year. Similarly, the pupil is no
longer required to learn uncommon forms which are not necessary for his
second-year reading.

Increased attention has been given to derivatives. Related English words are
often placed after the Latin words in the vocabularies of the lessons as well as
in the general vocabulary. Everywhere in the reviews this important part of the
study of Latin is kept constantly before the pupil. Suggestions are offered for
the keeping of notebooks of English derivatives. The force of certain common
prefixes and suffixes in the formation and meaning of Latin words is also
explained.

Interspersed throughout the book there are ten Review Lessons, which take up the
words and constructions previously taught. The machinery for drill has been
further strengthened by a summary of the uses of nouns and of verbs, and by
review questions touching upon the syntax, forms, derivatives, and principles of
each lesson. These questions have been placed after the Selections for Reading,
that they may be somewhat removed from the lessons they concern.

The treatment of the Essentials of Grammar has been made more useful by a
comparison of English grammar with Latin grammar, and by the inclusion of Latin
equivalents for the English illustrative words and phrases.

The material for reading has been somewhat changed, particularly by the omission
of the Fables and Stores, and by the introduction of the Story of Perseus, of
the simplified narrative of Cæsar's Campaign against the Helvetians, and of a
number of pages from Eutropius. In all the selections the syntax has been made
to conform with that taught in the lessons, so that the pupil may not be
bothered or discouraged by unfamiliar constructions.

As an aid to the pupil's pronunciation, a mark of accent has been placed on the
words in the vocabularies of the first eighteen lessons, and on declensions and
conjugations, both in the text and in the Appendix.

Teachers who are familiar with "First Year Latin" will find that none of its
well-known excellences have been sacrificed in the revision. There are, for
example, the same short lessons, usually less than two pages in length. In the
exercises the sentences for translation remain simple. Nowhere are many
constructions brought within the limits of a single sentence. The exercises for
translation from English into Latin are relatively shorter than those from Latin
into English. The order in which the verb is developed and in which the various
constructions are presented will be found the same, with a few exceptions. In
the study of syntax the pupil is still led from the observation of model
sentences to the deduction of usages and principles. Passages of connected Latin
are introduced early and are of frequent occurrence throughout the lessons, and
there is ample material for reading after the lessons have been completed. The
content of the book is still such that it is possible for high-school classes to
go through the lessons within thirty weeks.

The "Teacher's Manual," in addition to general directions and notes on each
lesson, contains carefully graded sentences for sight reading and for the
practice of the "direct method," as well as material for drill on English
derivatives of the Latin words of the vocabularies.

It is hoped that teachers will find the numerous illustrations a help to them in
familiarizing pupils with the life of the Romans. The four plates in colors were
made especially for this book by Mr. Arthur E. Becher after a careful study of
all the phases of Roman life that they represent. As for the other pictures,
half tones have been used where the subject could be made more realistic if
reproduced directly from a photograph. In cases where line engravings seemed
more suitable, drawings in the style of the early Italian engravings were made
for the purpose by Mr. Thomas M. Cleland, Mr. W. A. Dwiggins, and Mr. Adrian J.
Iorio. As a whole the illustrations are believed to be of a quality unexcelled
in schoolbooks.

The reviser wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to the  the suggestions
received from Mr. Collar himself, who, before his death, had given considerable
thought to the aim and scope of the revision. Indebtedness is also gratefully
acknowledged to Professor Charles Knapp, of Barnard College, New York; to Mr.
Herbert F. Hancox, of Lewis Institute, Chicago; and to Miss Grace I. Bridge and
Miss Grace E. Jackson, of the Hyde Park High School, Chicago, for their helpful
criticisms.

FIRST YEAR LATIN

ESSENTIALS OF GRAMMAR

THE PARTS OF SPEECH

NOUNS

I. a. A _noun_ is the name of a person, place, or thing: _boy_, _London_,
_ship_; *puer*, *Londīnium*, *nāvis*.

b. A _proper noun_ is the name of a particular person, place, or thing:
_Cornelia_, _Rome_, _Rhone_; *Cornēlia*, *Rōma*, *Rhodanus*.

c. A _common noun_ is a name that may be applied to any one of a class of
objects: _boy_, _city_, _day_; *puer*, *urbs*, *diēs*.

d. A _collective noun_ is a name that may be applied  to a group of objects,
though itself in the singular number (XXIII): _crowd_, _family_; *multitūdō*,
*gēns*.

e. A _verbal noun_ is the name of an action: _seeing_, _writing_, _to see_, _to
write_; *videndī* (459), *scrībendī*, *vidēre*, *scrībere*.

f. An _abstract noun_ is the name of a quality or condition: _goodness_,
_truth_, _poverty_; *bonitās*, *vēritās*, *paupertās*.

PRONOUNS

II. a. A _pronoun_ is a word used to take the place of a noun or of another
pronoun: _I_, _you_, _him_, _this_, _who_; *ego*, *tū*, *eum*, *hoc*, *quī*.

b. The noun (or pronoun) for which a pronoun stands is called its _antecedent_
(from *antecēdere*, _to go before_). Thus, in the sentence _John goes to school,
but he does not study_, the noun _John_ is the antecedent of _he_. The
antecedent is especially common with a relative pronoun (II, d). Neither in
Latin nor in English does the antecedent necessarily stand in advance of its
pronoun: _What he says, he believes_, *quod dīcit, _id_ crēdit*.

c. A _personal pronoun_ shows by its form whether it stands (1) for the speaker:
_I_, _we_; *ego*, *nōs*, that is, the _first person_; (2) for the person spoken
to: _thou_, _you_; *tū*, *vōs*, that is, the _second person_; or (3) for the
person or thing spoken of: _he_, _she_, _it_, _they_; *is*, *ea*, *id*, *eī*,
that is, the _third person_.

d. A _relative pronoun_ connects a subordinate clause, in which it stands, with
the antecedent: _The book *that* you have is mine_, *liber _quem_ habēs meus
est*. The relative pronouns in English are _who_, _which_, _that_, and _as_; in
Latin the relative is *quī*.

e. An _interrogative pronoun_ is used to ask a question: _*Who* is walking in
the garden?_ *_Quis_ in hortō ambulat?* The interrogative pronouns in English
are _who_, _which_, and _what_; in Latin, *quis* and *uter*.

f. A _demonstrative pronoun_ points out an object definitely: _this_, _that_,
_these_, _those_; *hic*, *ille*, *hī*, *illī*.


g. An _indefinite pronoun_ refers to an object indefinitely: _some_, _some one_,
_any_, _any one_; *aliquis*, *quis*.

h. A _reflexive pronoun refers back to the subject: _He blamed *himself*_, *_sē_
culpāvit*.

ADJECTIVES

III. a. An _adjective_ is a word used to qualify or limit a noun or a pronoun:
_*good* book_, _*beautiful* moon_, _*five* girls_; *liber _bonus_*, *lūna
_pulchra_*, *_quīnque_ puellae*.

b. _A_, _an_, and _the_, really limiting adjectives, are sometimes called
_articles_. _The_ is the _definite article_, _a_ or _an_ the _indefinite
article_. These articles are not used in Latin.

c. _Numeral adjectives_ denote how many persons or things are under
consideration. They are either _cardinal_, denoting how many: _one_, _two_,
_three_, _four_; *ūnus*, *duo*, *trēs*, *quattuor*; or _ordinal_, denoting which
in order: _first_, _second_, _third_, _fourth_; *prīmus*, *secundus*, *tertius*,
*quārtus*.

d. _Possessive adjectives_ denote ownership: _*my* friend_, _*our* house_;
*_meus_ amīcus*, *_nostra_ domus*. Possessive adjectives are frequently used as
possessive pronouns.

e. The demonstrative pronouns, the indefinite pronouns, and the interrogative
pronouns _which_ and _what_ may be used as adjectives, and are then called
respectively _demonstrative adjectives_: _*this* book_, _*that* house_; *_hic_
liber*, *_illa_ domus*; _indefinite adjectives_: _*some* boys_, *_aliquī_
puerī*; and _interrogative adjectives_: _*Which* way shall we go?_ *_Quā_ viā
ībimus?*

f. Adjectives are often used as nouns: "_The land of the *free*_," *patria
_līberōrum_*.

VERBS

IV. a. A _verb_ is a word which can declare or assert something about a person,
a place, or a thing: _The man *laughs*_, *vir _rīdet_*; _the town *is
captured*_, *oppidum _captum est_*; _the leaf *falls*_, *folium _cadit_*.

b. A verb which has an object (XIV, a) to complete its meaning is said to be
_transitive_, or to be _used transitively_: _The girl *has* a rose_, *puella
rosam _habet_*.

c. A verb which does not have an object (XIV, a) to complete its meaning is said
to be _intransitive_, or to be _used intransitively_: _Birds *fly*_, *avēs
_volant_*; _I *walk*_, *_abmulō_*.

NOTE. Thus certain verbs may at one time be transitive and at another
intransitive: _The wind *blew* the snow into our faces_; _the wind *blew*
furiously_.

d. Verbs are classified as _regular_ or _irregular_. This distinction is made
merely for convenience. A _regular verb_ in English forms its imperfect (past)
tense (XXXIII, a) and past participle (XXXIV, b) by the addition of _d_ or _ed_
to the present: present, _love_; past, _loved_; past participle, _loved_. For
Latin regular verbs see 658-662.

e. An _irregular verb_ in English does not form its imperfect (past) tense by
the addition of _d_ or _ed_ to the present: present, _give_; past _gave_; past
participle, _given_. For Latin irregular verbs see 663-668.

f. An _auxiliary verb_ is used in the conjugation of other verbs: _I *am*
loved_, _he *has* given_. In Latin the verb *esse*, _to be_ (663), is so used:
*missus _est_*, _he has been sent_.

ADVERBS

V. a. An _adverb_ is used to modify a verb, an adjective, or another adverb: _He
walks *swiftly*_, *_celeriter_ ambulat*.

b. An _adverb_ of _place_ answers the question _where?_ -- _here_, _there_,
_hence_; *hīc*, *illīc*, *hinc*.

c. An _adverb_ of _time_ answers the question _when?_ -- _then_, _now_, _often_;
*tum*, *nunc*, *saepe*.

d. An _adverb_ of _manner_ answers the question _how?_ -- _so_, _well_, _ill_;
*sīc*, *bene*, *male*.

e. An _adverb_ of _degree_ answers the question _how much?_ -- _little_,
_almost_, _enough_; *paulō*, *paene*, *satis*.

f. A _modal adverb_ expresses affirmation or negations, or the degree of
confidence with which a statement is made: _yes_, _no_, _certainly_, _perhaps_;
*certē*, *fortisan*.

PREPOSITIONS

VI. A preposition is used before a noun or pronoun to show its relation to
another word in the sentence. Usually the relation shown is position, direction,
or time: _He sent a legion *against* the enemy_, *_in_ hostēs legiōnem mīsit*.
In Latin certain phrases which would be introduced in English by a preposition
are expressed by the use of one of the cases (XXIV, b) without a preposition:
_*At dawn* he sent a legion_, *_prīmā lūce_ legiōnem mīsit*.

CONJUNCTIONS

VII. a. A _conjunction_ connects words, phrases (XVI), clauses (XX), and
sentences (XVIII): _boys *and* girls_, *puerī _et_ puellae*; _they fought
bravely *but* were conquered_, *fortiter pugnāvērunt _sed_ victī sunt*.

b. A _coördinate conjunction_ connects words, phrases, clauses, and sentences of
equal order or rank. The conjunctions in the examples in VII, a are coördinate.

c. A _subordinate conjunction_ connects a subordinate clause (XX, a) with a
principal clause (XX, a): _The boy was praised *because* he was industrious_,
*puer laudātus est _quod_ impiger erat*.

INTERJECTIONS

VIII. An _interjection_ is used to express strong feeling. It is not
grammatically related to any other word in the sentence: _oh!_ _ah!_ _alas!_
_hurrah!_ *ēheu!* *ecce!*

NOTE. The following couplets have often proved useful to young persons in
identifying the parts of speech:

    Three little words we often see
    Are Articles, _a_, _an_, and _the_.

    A Noun's the name of anything;
    As _school_ or _garden_, _hoop_ or _swing_.

    Adjectives tell the kind of noun;
    As _great_, _small_, _pretty_, _white_, or _brown_.

    Instead of nouns the Pronouns stand;
    _I_ come, _you_ go, as _they_ command.

    Verbs tell of something being done;
    As _read_, _write_, _spell_, _sing_, _jump_, or _run_.

    How things are done the Adverbs tell;
    As _slowly_, _quickly_, _ill_, or _well_.

    They also tell us where and when;
    As _here_ and _there_ and _now_ and _then_.

    A Preposition stands before
    A noun; as _in_ or _through_ a door.

    Conjunctions join the words together;
    As rain _and_ sunshine, wind _or_ weather.

    Conjunctions sentences unite;
    As kittens scratch _and_ puppies bite.

    An Interjection shows surprise;
    As _Oh!_ how pretty! _Ah!_ how wise!

THE SENTENCE

IX. A _sentence_ is a word or a group of words expressing a thought: _Stars
shine_; _he walks_; *stellae lūcent*; *ambulat*.

X. a. A _declarative sentence_ declares or asserts something: _The farmers are
plowing the fields_, *agricolae agrōs arant*.

b. An _interrogative sentence_ asks a question: _Why are the farmers plowing the
fields?_ *Cūr agricolae agrōs arant?*

c. An _imperative sentence_ expresses a command, a request, or an entreaty:
_Plow the fields to-day_, *hodiē agrōs arāte*.

d. An _exclamatory sentence_ expresses strong feeling or emotion: _Would that he
had remained!_ *Utinam mānsisset!*

XI. a. A sentence is made up of two parts, one called the _subject_ and the
other the _predicate_.

b. The _subject_ represents the person, place, or thing about which something is
declared or asserted: _*Birds* sing_, *_avēs_ cantant*.

c. The _predicate_ declares or asserts something about the person, place, or
thing which the subject represents: _Birds *sing*_, *avēs _cantant_*.

NOTE. In English and in Latin either the subject or the predicate, or both, may be enlarged to any extent by the addition of qualifying words and expressions called modifiers: _*My sister's small* birds_ | _sing *sweetly in the morning*_.

XII. The _simple subject_ is the noun or pronoun which signifies the person,
place, or thing about which the assertion is made. The _simple predicate_ is the
verb that makes the assertion. _Birds_ is the simple subject, and _sing_ the
simple predicate, in the note under XI, c.

XIII. The _complete subject_ is the simple subject with all its modifiers. The
_complete predicate_ is the simple predicate with all its modifiers. Thus, in
the example in the note under XI, c the complete subject is all that precedes
the vertical line, and the complete predicate all that follows it.

XIV. a. The _object_ of a verb is a word or an expression that completes the
meaning of the verb, and signifies that which is affected by the action: _He
sent *messengers*_, *_nūntiōs_ mīsit*; _he wished *me to go to italy*_, *_mē in
Italiam īre_ voluit*.

b. The _direct object_ represents that which is immediately affected by the
action of the verb; the _indirect object_ that to or for which the action is
performed. Thus, in _He gave *me* a *book*_, *_mihi librum_ dedit*, _book_ is
the direct object, and _me_ the indirect.

XV. a. A _predicate noun_ or a _predicate adjective_ is used after certain
intransitive or passive verbs to complete their meaning, and to describe or
define the subject: _Marcus is a *sailor*_; _the sailor is *brave*_; *Mārcus
_nauta_ est*; *nauta _fortis_ est*.

b. The predicate noun or adjective is called the _complement_ of the verb.
Intransitive verbs that require a complement are called _copulative verbs_. The
verb _be_ (Latin *esse*) in its various forms (_am_, _was_, _has been_, etc.) is
often called the _copula_.

c. The predicate noun or adjective has the same case as the subject; hence the
term _predicate nominative_.

XVI. a. A _phrase_ is a combination of words (not subject and predicate) used as
a single part of speech.

b. An _adjective phrase_ modifies a noun: _A man *of great valor*_, *vir _magnae
virtūtis_*.

c. An _adverbial phrase_ modifies a verb: _They work *with great diligence*_,
*_magnā cum diligentiā_ labōrant*. In Latin certain cases of nouns are used to
express what in English would be prepositional phrases of an adverbial nature
(VI).

XVII. A _simple sentence_ contains but one statement, that is, one subject and
one predicate: _Cæsar drew up a line of battle_, *Caesar aciem īnstrūxit*.

XVIII. A _compound sentence_ contains two or more independent statements: _Cæsar
drew up a line of battle, but the enemy fled_, *Caesar aciem īnstrūxit, sed
hostēs fūgērunt*.

NOTE. An independent statement is one that can stand alone; it does not depend
on (qualify or limit) another statement.

XIX. A _complex sentence_ contains one independent (principal) statement and one
or more dependent (subordinate) statements: _When the messenger had replied, the
lieutenant spoke as follows_, *cum nūntius respondisset, lēgātus haec dīxit*.

NOTE. A dependent, or subordiate, statement is one that qualifies or limits
another in some way; thus, the dependent statement _when the messenger had
replied_ limits the verb _spoke_, telling when the lieutenant spoke.

XX. a. The separate statements in a compound or a complex sentence are called
_clauses_, and, as has already been seen, they may be either _independent_
(_principal_) or _dependent_ (_subordinate_).

b. When dependent (subordinate) clauses modify nouns or pronouns they are called
_adjective clauses_: _The girls *whom we praised* were good_, *puellae _quās
laudāvimus_ bonae erant*.

c. When dependent (subordinate) clauses modify verbs they are called _adverbial
clauses_: _*When the messenger had replied,* the lietenant spoke as follows_,
*_cum nūntius respondisset,_ lēgātus haec dīxit*.

d. When dependent (subordinate) clauses are used as nouns they are called
_substandtive clauses_: _*That you are here* pleases us_, *_quod ades_ nōs
dēlectat*.

e. Dependent (subordinate) clauses introduced by _when_ (Latin *cum*, *ubi*,
etc.) are called _temporal clauses_; introduced by _because_ (Latin *quod*
etc.), they are called _causal clauses_; introduced by _if_ (Latin *sī*), they
are called _conditional clauses_; introduced by _although_ (Latin *cum*, *etsī*,
etc.), they are called _concessive clauses_; introduced by a relative pronoun
(Latin *quī*), they are called _relative clauses_.

f. The independent clause of a complex sentence is called the _principal
clause_. Connected clauses that are of the same rank, both independent or both
dependent, are said to be _coördinate_.

INFLECTION

XXI. _Inflection_ is a change in the form of a word to indicate a change in its
meaning or use: _man_, _men_, _boy_, _boy's_, _love_, _loved_; *vir*, *virī*,
*puer*, *puerī*, *amant*, *amābant*.

DECLENSION

XXII. The inflection of a noun or pronoun is called its _declension_. Nouns and
pronouns in English are declined to show number and case, and a few nouns to
show gender. In Latin the nouns and pronouns are declined; adjectives also are
declined in gender, number, and case to agree with the nouns which they modify.

_Number_

XXIII. A noun or pronoun is in the _singular number_ when it means one person,
place, or thing: _town_, _city_, _I_; *oppidum*, *urbs*, *ego*; in the _plural
number_ when it means more than one person, place, or thing: _towns_, _cities_,
_we_; *oppida*, *urbēs*, *nōs*.

_Case_

XXIV. a. The several forms taken by words that are declined are called _cases_.
In English there are the following cases, to indicate the uses of nouns and
pronouns:

1. The _nominative_, primarily used as the subject of a sentence: _*He* throws
the ball_.

2. The _possessive_ (genitive), used to denote possession or ownership: _John
throws *his* ball_; _see the *queen's* crown_.

3. The _objective_ (accusative), used as the object of a transitive verb or of a
preposition: _John throws the *ball* to *him*_.

4. The _dative_, used to express the indirect object of the verb: _John throws
*him* the ball_. Only personal pronouns and the pronoun _who_ have separate
forms for these cases in English.

Nouns have the nominative, objective, and dative alike, with a separate form for
the possessive.

b. In Latin there are seven cases: _nominative_, _genitive_, _dative_,
_accusative_, _ablative_, _vocative_, and _locative_; but a single form
sometimes does duty for several cases (cf. *agricola*, 63). The nominiative,
genitive, and accusative cases are used much like the same cases in English. The
dative expresses in general that relation of words to other words which is
expressed in English by prepositional phrases beginning with _to_ or _for_: _to
the farmer_, _for the man_. The ablative expresses in general that relation of
words to other words which is expressed in English by prepositional phrases
beginning with _from_, _with_, _by_, _in_: _with a spear_, _by a story_.

c. The direct object of a verb in Latin is the accusative case, but sometimes
the direct object in English is expressed in Latin by he dative (425, 433).

_Gender_

XXV. a. The gender of English nouns is what is called _natural gender_, and
hence has very little to do with grammar. Thus, a noun denoting a male is in the
_masculine gender_: _man_, _boy_, _father_; a noun denoting a female is in the
_feminine gender_: _woman_, _girl_, _mother_; one denoting either male or female
is in the _common gender_: _cat_, _dog_, _parent_; one denoting a sexless object
is in the _neuter gender_: _river_, _wind_, _mountain_.

b. In Latin only nouns that denote persons and some animals have natural gender:
*nauta*, _sailor_ (masc.); *māter*, _mother_ (fem.). All others have an
arbitrary gender, called _grammatical gender_, determined chiefly by the ending:
*flūmen*, _river_ (neut.); *ventus*, _wind_ (masc.); *nūbēs*, _cloud_ (fem.).

COMPARISON

XXVI. a. English adjectives and adverbs are inflected to show degree. This is
called _comparison_. There are three degrees of comparison, the _positive_, the
_comparative_, and the _superlative_: positive _wise_, comparative _wiser_,
superlative _wisest_; positive _good_, comparative _better_, superlative _best_;
positive _often_, comparative _oftener_, superlative _oftenest_.

b. Adjectives and adverbs are also compared in English by prefixing the adverbs
_more_ and _most_: _beautiful_, _more beautiful_, _most beautiful_.

c. Comparison in Latin is indicated exactly as in English: *sapiēns*,
*sapientior*, *sapientissimus*; *bonus*, *melior*, *optimus*; *idōneus*, *magis
idōneus*, *maximē idōneus*; *saepe*, *saepis*, *saepissimē*.

CONJUGATION

XXVII. a. The inflection of a verb is called _conjugation_. Verbs are
conujugated to show voice, mood, and tense, and the number and person of the
subject.

b. The English verb has but few changes of form. Thus the verb _love_ has in
common use only the forms _love_, _loves_, _loving_, and _loved_. Most of the
conjugation of the verb is made up of verb phrases formed by the use of
auxiliaries (IV, f): _I am loved_, _I shall love_, _I shall have been loved_,
etc.

c. The Latin verb has many changes in form to show voice, mood, tense, number,
and person: *amor*, _I am loved_; *amābō*, _I shall love_; *amātus erō*, _I
shall have been loved_.

_Voice_

XXVIII. A verb is in the _active voice_ when it represents the subject as acting
(or being): _The man *praised* the boy_, *vir puerum _laudāvit_*. A verb is in
the _passive voice_ when it represents the subject as acted on: _The boy *was
praised* by the man_, *puer ā virō _laudātus est_*.

_Mood_

XXIX. A verb is in the _indicative mood_ when it is used in stating a fact or in
asking a question: _The citizens *are assembling*_, *cīvēs _conveniunt_*; _why
*do* they *carry* arms?_ *cūr arma _portant_?*

XXX. a. In English a verb is in the _subjunctive mood_ when it asserts something doubtfully or conditionally. It is used in subordinate clauses, and is usually introduced by _if_, _though_, and the like: _If he *were* here, I should be glad_; _"Though he *slay* me, yet will I trust in him."_

NOTE. The subjunctive is very little used in modern English, its place being
taken by the indicative.

b. In Latin the subjunctive has a great variety of uses, in independent as well
as in dependent clauses (344, 358, 373, etc.).

XXXI. a. A verb is in the _imperative mood_ when it expresses command, request,
or entreaty: _*Fortify* the city_, *urbem _mūnīte_*.

b. Unless emphatic the subject of the imperative (_thou_ or _you_) is not
expressed either in English or in Latin.

_The Infinitive_

XXXII. a. The _infinitive_ in English (_to love_, _to have loved_, etc.) is a
verbal noun. It has neither person nor number. Like a noun it may be the subject
or the object or the complement of a verb: _*To see* is *to believe*_; _he
wishes *to go* home_. Like a verb it may have a subject, an object, and
adverbial modifiers: _We wish *you* to being your *work early*_.

b. The Latin infinitive is used in the same way that the English infinitive is
used. It differs, however, from the English infinitive in not being used in
prose in expressions of purpose (_They came *to see* me), and in being used
constantly for the verb of a statement that is given indirectly: _He said that
*he would come*_, *dīxit _se ventūrum esse_*.

c. The verbal noun in _-ing_ is sometimes called an infinitive: _*Seeing* is
*believing*_ = _to see is to believe_. This verbal noun has its counterpart in
the Latin gerund (459).

_Tense_

XXXIII. a. A verb is in the _present_, _past_ (_imperfect_), or _future_ tense
according as it represents an action as taking place in present, past, or future
time: _I love_, _I loved (was loving)_, _I shall love_; *amō*, *amābam*,
*amābō*.

b. The _present perfect_ (_perfect_) tense represents an action completed in the
present: _I have loved_, *amāvī*; the _past perfect_ (_pluperfect_) an action
completed in the past before some other past action or state: _I had loved_,
*amāveram*; and the _future perfect_ an action completed in the future before
some other future action or state: _I shall have loved_, *amāverō*.

_The Participle_

XXXIV. a. The _participle_ is a verbal adjective. Like an adjective it may
qualify a noun: _*struggling* soldiers_, *mīlitēs _labōrantēs*. Like a verb it
may have an object and adverbial modifiers: _Fearing *danger* they remained in
the camp_, *_perīculum_ veritī in castrīs mānsērunt*.

b. There are in English three participles in the active voice: present,
_loving_; past, _loved_; perfect, _having loved_; and three in the passive
voice: present, _(being) loved_; past, _loved_; perfect, _having been loved_. In
Latin the past and perfect active and the present passive participles are
wanting, but there is a future participle.

c. The participle in _-ing_ is used with the auxiliary _be_ to make the
progressive form of the verb: _you *are loving*_, _he *was loving*_, _they *will
be loving*_. Latin has no special tenses for the progressive forms.
