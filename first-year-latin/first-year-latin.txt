Italics are represented using _underscores_ and boldface using
*asterisks*.

The footnotes have been renumbered so that all footnotes can be
given at the end of each chapter.

In Lesson XLVIII, in the table of case endings for nouns of the
fifth declension, the genitive and dative singular were listed as
*-̆̄eī*, where the first letter uses a combining macron and a
combining breve to produce both diacritics on the same letter
'e'. For readability, I expanded this contracted notation to
*-ĕī*, *-ēī* separately.

Occasionally, curly braces were used to abbreviate repetitive
tables of conjugations or declensions (e.g. 342). While this made
the original text more concise, it doesn't translate well to a
plain-text format, so I expanded the tables at the expense of
conciseness.

KNOWN ERRORS

412. *nūntiāvi* should be *nūntiāvī*.
413.4. Eaedam should be Eaedem.

TODO: fix all explicit page references to point to sections

PREFACE

The book that is placed in the hands of a pupil during his first
year of the study of Latin should be simple and clear and
interesting in its treatment of the language; it should teach
with the utmost thoroughness those principles that it attempts to
teach, but it should not attempt to teach to-day what may be be
taught more properly to-morrow; it should get the pupil into the
reading of easy connected Latin as soon as possible, and for this
purpose should supply a generous amount of material graded to his
attainment; and it should never allow the pupil to leave the
classroom without a reminder of the extent to which Latin is a
part of his own language.

With these convictions the revision of Collar and Daniell's
"First Year Latin" was undertaken. All these principles underlay
the plan of "First Year Latin," but the unanimity with which they
have been accepted since the publication of that text has made it
possible in the revision so to extend their application as to
produce what is in effect a new book.

The vocabulary has been made briefer and more Cæsarian. From the
vocabularies of the lessons the pupil is asked to learn the
meanings of some five hundred and seventy words. About ninety per
cent of these words are included in the list of one thousand
words which Professor Lodge [1] suggests should be learned before
the end of the second year of the study of Latin. Over sixty per
cent occur more than ten times in Cæsar. In the Selections for
Reading the pupil has a chance to become acquainted casually with
a wider vocabulary.

A number of constructions which were taught in the original book
have been omitted. With three exceptions the constructions
included in the revision are those which Byrne [2] recommends for
the first year. Similarly, the pupil is no longer required to
learn uncommon forms which are not necessary for his second-year
reading.

Increased attention has been given to derivatives. Related
English words are often placed after the Latin words in the
vocabularies of the lessons as well as in the general vocabulary.
Everywhere in the reviews this important part of the study of
Latin is kept constantly before the pupil. Suggestions are
offered for the keeping of notebooks of English derivatives. The
force of certain common prefixes and suffixes in the formation
and meaning of Latin words is also explained.

Interspersed throughout the book there are ten Review Lessons,
which take up the words and constructions previously taught. The
machinery for drill has been further strengthened by a summary of
the uses of nouns and of verbs, and by review questions touching
upon the syntax, forms, derivatives, and principles of each
lesson. These questions have been placed after the Selections for
Reading, that they may be somewhat removed from the lessons they
concern.

The treatment of the Essentials of Grammar has been made more
useful by a comparison of English grammar with Latin grammar, and
by the inclusion of Latin equivalents for the English
illustrative words and phrases.

The material for reading has been somewhat changed, particularly
by the omission of the Fables and Stories, and by the
introduction of the Story of Perseus, of the simplified narrative
of Cæsar's Campaign against the Helvetians, and of a number of
pages from Eutropius. In all the selections the syntax has been
made to conform with that taught in the lessons, so that the
pupil may not be bothered or discouraged by unfamiliar
constructions.

As an aid to the pupil's pronunciation, a mark of accent has been
placed on the words in the vocabularies of the first eighteen
lessons, and on declensions and conjugations, both in the text
and in the Appendix.

Teachers who are familiar with "First Year Latin" will find that
none of its well-known excellences have been sacrificed in the
revision. There are, for example, the same short lessons, usually
less than two pages in length. In the exercises the sentences for
translation remain simple. Nowhere are many constructions brought
within the limits of a single sentence. The exercises for
translation from English into Latin are relatively shorter than
those from Latin into English. The order in which the verb is
developed and in which the various constructions are presented
will be found the same, with a few exceptions. In the study of
syntax the pupil is still led from the observation of model
sentences to the deduction of usages and principles. Passages of
connected Latin are introduced early and are of frequent
occurrence throughout the lessons, and there is ample material
for reading after the lessons have been completed. The content of
the book is still such that it is possible for high-school
classes to go through the lessons within thirty weeks.

The "Teacher's Manual," in addition to general directions and
notes on each lesson, contains carefully graded sentences for
sight reading and for the practice of the "direct method," as
well as material for drill on English derivatives of the Latin
words of the vocabularies.

It is hoped that teachers will find the numerous illustrations a
help to them in familiarizing pupils with the life of the Romans.
The four plates in colors were made especially for this book by
Mr. Arthur E. Becher after a careful study of all the phases of
Roman life that they represent. As for the other pictures, half
tones have been used where the subject could be made more
realistic if reproduced directly from a photograph. In cases
where line engravings seemed more suitable, drawings in the style
of the early Italian engravings were made for the purpose by Mr.
Thomas M. Cleland, Mr. W. A. Dwiggins, and Mr. Adrian J. Iorio.
As a whole the illustrations are believed to be of a quality
unexcelled in schoolbooks.

The reviser wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to the  the
suggestions received from Mr. Collar himself, who, before his
death, had given considerable thought to the aim and scope of the
revision. Indebtedness is also gratefully acknowledged to
Professor Charles Knapp, of Barnard College, New York; to Mr.
Herbert F. Hancox, of Lewis Institute, Chicago; and to Miss Grace
I. Bridge and Miss Grace E. Jackson, of the Hyde Park High
School, Chicago, for their helpful criticisms.

ESSENTIALS OF GRAMMAR

THE PARTS OF SPEECH

NOUNS

I. a. A _noun_ is the name of a person, place, or thing: _boy_,
_London_, _ship_; *puer*, *Londīnium*, *nāvis*.

b. A _proper noun_ is the name of a particular person, place, or
thing: _Cornelia_, _Rome_, _Rhone_; *Cornēlia*, *Rōma*,
*Rhodanus*.

c. A _common noun_ is a name that may be applied to any one of a
class of objects: _boy_, _city_, _day_; *puer*, *urbs*, *diēs*.

d. A _collective noun_ is a name that may be applied  to a group
of objects, though itself in the singular number (XXIII):
_crowd_, _family_; *multitūdō*, *gēns*.

e. A _verbal noun_ is the name of an action: _seeing_, _writing_,
_to see_, _to write_; *videndī* (459), *scrībendī*, *vidēre*,
*scrībere*.

f. An _abstract noun_ is the name of a quality or condition:
_goodness_, _truth_, _poverty_; *bonitās*, *vēritās*,
*paupertās*.

PRONOUNS

II. a. A _pronoun_ is a word used to take the place of a noun or
of another pronoun: _I_, _you_, _him_, _this_, _who_; *ego*,
*tū*, *eum*, *hoc*, *quī*.

b. The noun (or pronoun) for which a pronoun stands is called its
_antecedent_ (from *antecēdere*, _to go before_). Thus, in the
sentence _John goes to school, but he does not study_, the noun
_John_ is the antecedent of _he_. The antecedent is especially
common with a relative pronoun (II, d). Neither in Latin nor in
English does the antecedent necessarily stand in advance of its
pronoun: _What he says, he believes_, *quod dīcit, _id_ crēdit*.

c. A _personal pronoun_ shows by its form whether it stands (1)
for the speaker: _I_, _we_; *ego*, *nōs*, that is, the _first
person_; (2) for the person spoken to: _thou_, _you_; *tū*,
*vōs*, that is, the _second person_; or (3) for the person or
thing spoken of: _he_, _she_, _it_, _they_; *is*, *ea*, *id*,
*eī*, that is, the _third person_.

d. A _relative pronoun_ connects a subordinate clause, in which
it stands, with the antecedent: _The book *that* you have is
mine_, *liber _quem_ habēs meus est*. The relative pronouns in
English are _who_, _which_, _that_, and _as_; in Latin the
relative is *quī*.

e. An _interrogative pronoun_ is used to ask a question: _*Who*
is walking in the garden?_ *_Quis_ in hortō ambulat?* The
interrogative pronouns in English are _who_, _which_, and _what_;
in Latin, *quis* and *uter*.

f. A _demonstrative pronoun_ points out an object definitely:
_this_, _that_, _these_, _those_; *hic*, *ille*, *hī*, *illī*.

g. An _indefinite pronoun_ refers to an object indefinitely:
_some_, _some one_, _any_, _any one_; *aliquis*, *quis*.

h. A _reflexive pronoun refers back to the subject: _He blamed
*himself*_, *_sē_ culpāvit*.

ADJECTIVES

III. a. An _adjective_ is a word used to qualify or limit a noun
or a pronoun: _*good* book_, _*beautiful* moon_, _*five* girls_;
*liber _bonus_*, *lūna _pulchra_*, *_quīnque_ puellae*.

b. _A_, _an_, and _the_, really limiting adjectives, are
sometimes called _articles_. _The_ is the _definite article_, _a_
or _an_ the _indefinite article_. These articles are not used in
Latin.

c. _Numeral adjectives_ denote how many persons or things are
under consideration. They are either _cardinal_, denoting how
many: _one_, _two_, _three_, _four_; *ūnus*, *duo*, *trēs*,
*quattuor*; or _ordinal_, denoting which in order: _first_,
_second_, _third_, _fourth_; *prīmus*, *secundus*, *tertius*,
*quārtus*.

d. _Possessive adjectives_ denote ownership: _*my* friend_,
_*our* house_; *_meus_ amīcus*, *_nostra_ domus*. Possessive
adjectives are frequently used as possessive pronouns.

e. The demonstrative pronouns, the indefinite pronouns, and the
interrogative pronouns _which_ and _what_ may be used as
adjectives, and are then called respectively _demonstrative
adjectives_: _*this* book_, _*that* house_; *_hic_ liber*,
*_illa_ domus*; _indefinite adjectives_: _*some* boys_, *_aliquī_
puerī*; and _interrogative adjectives_: _*Which* way shall we
go?_ *_Quā_ viā ībimus?*

f. Adjectives are often used as nouns: "_The land of the
*free*_," *patria _līberōrum_*.

VERBS

IV. a. A _verb_ is a word which can declare or assert something
about a person, a place, or a thing: _The man *laughs*_, *vir
_rīdet_*; _the town *is captured*_, *oppidum _captum est_*; _the
leaf *falls*_, *folium _cadit_*.

b. A verb which has an object (XIV, a) to complete its meaning is
said to be _transitive_, or to be _used transitively_: _The girl
*has* a rose_, *puella rosam _habet_*.

c. A verb which does not have an object (XIV, a) to complete its
meaning is said to be _intransitive_, or to be _used
intransitively_: _Birds *fly*_, *avēs _volant_*; _I *walk*_,
*_abmulō_*.

NOTE. Thus certain verbs may at one time be transitive and at
another intransitive: _The wind *blew* the snow into our faces_;
_the wind *blew* furiously_.

d. Verbs are classified as _regular_ or _irregular_. This
distinction is made merely for convenience. A _regular verb_ in
English forms its imperfect (past) tense (XXXIII, a) and past
participle (XXXIV, b) by the addition of _d_ or _ed_ to the
present: present, _love_; past, _loved_; past participle,
_loved_. For Latin regular verbs see 658-662.

e. An _irregular verb_ in English does not form its imperfect
(past) tense by the addition of _d_ or _ed_ to the present:
present, _give_; past _gave_; past participle, _given_. For Latin
irregular verbs see 663-668.

f. An _auxiliary verb_ is used in the conjugation of other verbs:
_I *am* loved_, _he *has* given_. In Latin the verb *esse*, _to
be_ (663), is so used: *missus _est_*, _he has been sent_.

ADVERBS

V. a. An _adverb_ is used to modify a verb, an adjective, or
another adverb: _He walks *swiftly*_, *_celeriter_ ambulat*.

b. An _adverb_ of _place_ answers the question _where?_ --
_here_, _there_, _hence_; *hīc*, *illīc*, *hinc*.

c. An _adverb_ of _time_ answers the question _when?_ -- _then_,
_now_, _often_; *tum*, *nunc*, *saepe*.

d. An _adverb_ of _manner_ answers the question _how?_ -- _so_,
_well_, _ill_; *sīc*, *bene*, *male*.

e. An _adverb_ of _degree_ answers the question _how much?_ --
_little_, _almost_, _enough_; *paulō*, *paene*, *satis*.

f. A _modal adverb_ expresses affirmation or negations, or the
degree of confidence with which a statement is made: _yes_, _no_,
_certainly_, _perhaps_; *certē*, *fortisan*.

PREPOSITIONS

VI. A preposition is used before a noun or pronoun to show its
relation to another word in the sentence. Usually the relation
shown is position, direction, or time: _He sent a legion
*against* the enemy_, *_in_ hostēs legiōnem mīsit*. In Latin
certain phrases which would be introduced in English by a
preposition are expressed by the use of one of the cases (XXIV,
b) without a preposition: _*At dawn* he sent a legion_, *_prīmā
lūce_ legiōnem mīsit*.

CONJUNCTIONS

VII. a. A _conjunction_ connects words, phrases (XVI), clauses
(XX), and sentences (XVIII): _boys *and* girls_, *puerī _et_
puellae*; _they fought bravely *but* were conquered_, *fortiter
pugnāvērunt _sed_ victī sunt*.

b. A _coördinate conjunction_ connects words, phrases, clauses,
and sentences of equal order or rank. The conjunctions in the
examples in VII, a are coördinate.

c. A _subordinate conjunction_ connects a subordinate clause (XX,
a) with a principal clause (XX, a): _The boy was praised
*because* he was industrious_, *puer laudātus est _quod_ impiger
erat*.

INTERJECTIONS

VIII. An _interjection_ is used to express strong feeling. It is
not grammatically related to any other word in the sentence:
_oh!_ _ah!_ _alas!_ _hurrah!_ *ēheu!* *ecce!*

NOTE. The following couplets have often proved useful to young
persons in identifying the parts of speech:

    Three little words we often see Are Articles, _a_, _an_, and
    _the_.

    A Noun's the name of anything; As _school_ or _garden_,
    _hoop_ or _swing_.

    Adjectives tell the kind of noun; As _great_, _small_,
    _pretty_, _white_, or _brown_.

    Instead of nouns the Pronouns stand; _I_ come, _you_ go, as
    _they_ command.

    Verbs tell of something being done; As _read_, _write_,
    _spell_, _sing_, _jump_, or _run_.

    How things are done the Adverbs tell; As _slowly_, _quickly_,
    _ill_, or _well_.

    They also tell us where and when; As _here_ and _there_ and
    _now_ and _then_.

    A Preposition stands before A noun; as _in_ or _through_ a
    door.

    Conjunctions join the words together; As rain _and_ sunshine,
    wind _or_ weather.

    Conjunctions sentences unite; As kittens scratch _and_
    puppies bite.

    An Interjection shows surprise; As _Oh!_ how pretty! _Ah!_
    how wise!

THE SENTENCE

IX. A _sentence_ is a word or a group of words expressing a
thought: _Stars shine_; _he walks_; *stellae lūcent*; *ambulat*.

X. a. A _declarative sentence_ declares or asserts something:
_The farmers are plowing the fields_, *agricolae agrōs arant*.

b. An _interrogative sentence_ asks a question: _Why are the
farmers plowing the fields?_ *Cūr agricolae agrōs arant?*

c. An _imperative sentence_ expresses a command, a request, or an
entreaty: _Plow the fields to-day_, *hodiē agrōs arāte*.

d. An _exclamatory sentence_ expresses strong feeling or emotion:
_Would that he had remained!_ *Utinam mānsisset!*

XI. a. A sentence is made up of two parts, one called the
_subject_ and the other the _predicate_.

b. The _subject_ represents the person, place, or thing about
which something is declared or asserted: _*Birds* sing_, *_avēs_
cantant*.

c. The _predicate_ declares or asserts something about the
person, place, or thing which the subject represents: _Birds
*sing*_, *avēs _cantant_*.

NOTE. In English and in Latin either the subject or the
predicate, or both, may be enlarged to any extent by the addition
of qualifying words and expressions called modifiers: _*My
sister's small* birds_ | _sing *sweetly in the morning*_.

XII. The _simple subject_ is the noun or pronoun which signifies
the person, place, or thing about which the assertion is made.
The _simple predicate_ is the verb that makes the assertion.
_Birds_ is the simple subject, and _sing_ the simple predicate,
in the note under XI, c.

XIII. The _complete subject_ is the simple subject with all its
modifiers. The _complete predicate_ is the simple predicate with
all its modifiers. Thus, in the example in the note under XI, c
the complete subject is all that precedes the vertical line, and
the complete predicate all that follows it.

XIV. a. The _object_ of a verb is a word or an expression that
completes the meaning of the verb, and signifies that which is
affected by the action: _He sent *messengers*_, *_nūntiōs_
mīsit*; _he wished *me to go to italy*_, *_mē in Italiam īre_
voluit*.

b. The _direct object_ represents that which is immediately
affected by the action of the verb; the _indirect object_ that to
or for which the action is performed. Thus, in _He gave *me* a
*book*_, *_mihi librum_ dedit*, _book_ is the direct object, and
_me_ the indirect.

XV. a. A _predicate noun_ or a _predicate adjective_ is used
after certain intransitive or passive verbs to complete their
meaning, and to describe or define the subject: _Marcus is a
*sailor*_; _the sailor is *brave*_; *Mārcus _nauta_ est*; *nauta
_fortis_ est*.

b. The predicate noun or adjective is called the _complement_ of
the verb. Intransitive verbs that require a complement are called
_copulative verbs_. The verb _be_ (Latin *esse*) in its various
forms (_am_, _was_, _has been_, etc.) is often called the
_copula_.

c. The predicate noun or adjective has the same case as the
subject; hence the term _predicate nominative_.

XVI. a. A _phrase_ is a combination of words (not subject and
predicate) used as a single part of speech.

b. An _adjective phrase_ modifies a noun: _A man *of great
valor*_, *vir _magnae virtūtis_*.

c. An _adverbial phrase_ modifies a verb: _They work *with great
diligence*_, *_magnā cum diligentiā_ labōrant*. In Latin certain
cases of nouns are used to express what in English would be
prepositional phrases of an adverbial nature (VI).

XVII. A _simple sentence_ contains but one statement, that is,
one subject and one predicate: _Cæsar drew up a line of battle_,
*Caesar aciem īnstrūxit*.

XVIII. A _compound sentence_ contains two or more independent
statements: _Cæsar drew up a line of battle, but the enemy fled_,
*Caesar aciem īnstrūxit, sed hostēs fūgērunt*.

NOTE. An independent statement is one that can stand alone; it
does not depend on (qualify or limit) another statement.

XIX. A _complex sentence_ contains one independent (principal)
statement and one or more dependent (subordinate) statements:
_When the messenger had replied, the lieutenant spoke as
follows_, *cum nūntius respondisset, lēgātus haec dīxit*.

NOTE. A dependent, or subordiate, statement is one that qualifies
or limits another in some way; thus, the dependent statement
_when the messenger had replied_ limits the verb _spoke_, telling
when the lieutenant spoke.

XX. a. The separate statements in a compound or a complex
sentence are called _clauses_, and, as has already been seen,
they may be either _independent_ (_principal_) or _dependent_
(_subordinate_).

b. When dependent (subordinate) clauses modify nouns or pronouns
they are called _adjective clauses_: _The girls *whom we praised*
were good_, *puellae _quās laudāvimus_ bonae erant*.

c. When dependent (subordinate) clauses modify verbs they are
called _adverbial clauses_: _*When the messenger had replied,*
the lietenant spoke as follows_, *_cum nūntius respondisset,_
lēgātus haec dīxit*.

d. When dependent (subordinate) clauses are used as nouns they
are called _substandtive clauses_: _*That you are here* pleases
us_, *_quod ades_ nōs dēlectat*.

e. Dependent (subordinate) clauses introduced by _when_ (Latin
*cum*, *ubi*, etc.) are called _temporal clauses_; introduced by
_because_ (Latin *quod* etc.), they are called _causal clauses_;
introduced by _if_ (Latin *sī*), they are called _conditional
clauses_; introduced by _although_ (Latin *cum*, *etsī*, etc.),
they are called _concessive clauses_; introduced by a relative
pronoun (Latin *quī*), they are called _relative clauses_.

f. The independent clause of a complex sentence is called the
_principal clause_. Connected clauses that are of the same rank,
both independent or both dependent, are said to be _coördinate_.

INFLECTION

XXI. _Inflection_ is a change in the form of a word to indicate a
change in its meaning or use: _man_, _men_, _boy_, _boy's_,
_love_, _loved_; *vir*, *virī*, *puer*, *puerī*, *amant*,
*amābant*.

DECLENSION

XXII. The inflection of a noun or pronoun is called its
_declension_. Nouns and pronouns in English are declined to show
number and case, and a few nouns to show gender. In Latin the
nouns and pronouns are declined; adjectives also are declined in
gender, number, and case to agree with the nouns which they
modify.

_Number_

XXIII. A noun or pronoun is in the _singular number_ when it
means one person, place, or thing: _town_, _city_, _I_;
*oppidum*, *urbs*, *ego*; in the _plural number_ when it means
more than one person, place, or thing: _towns_, _cities_, _we_;
*oppida*, *urbēs*, *nōs*.

_Case_

XXIV. a. The several forms taken by words that are declined are
called _cases_. In English there are the following cases, to
indicate the uses of nouns and pronouns:

1. The _nominative_, primarily used as the subject of a sentence:
_*He* throws the ball_.

2. The _possessive_ (genitive), used to denote possession or
ownership: _John throws *his* ball_; _see the *queen's* crown_.

3. The _objective_ (accusative), used as the object of a
transitive verb or of a preposition: _John throws the *ball* to
*him*_.

4. The _dative_, used to express the indirect object of the verb:
_John throws *him* the ball_. Only personal pronouns and the
pronoun _who_ have separate forms for these cases in English.

Nouns have the nominative, objective, and dative alike, with a
separate form for the possessive.

b. In Latin there are seven cases: _nominative_, _genitive_,
_dative_, _accusative_, _ablative_, _vocative_, and _locative_;
but a single form sometimes does duty for several cases (cf.
*agricola*, 63). The nominiative, genitive, and accusative cases
are used much like the same cases in English. The dative
expresses in general that relation of words to other words which
is expressed in English by prepositional phrases beginning with
_to_ or _for_: _to the farmer_, _for the man_. The ablative
expresses in general that relation of words to other words which
is expressed in English by prepositional phrases beginning with
_from_, _with_, _by_, _in_: _with a spear_, _by a story_.

c. The direct object of a verb in Latin is the accusative case,
but sometimes the direct object in English is expressed in Latin
by he dative (425, 433).

_Gender_

XXV. a. The gender of English nouns is what is called _natural
gender_, and hence has very little to do with grammar. Thus, a
noun denoting a male is in the _masculine gender_: _man_, _boy_,
_father_; a noun denoting a female is in the _feminine gender_:
_woman_, _girl_, _mother_; one denoting either male or female is
in the _common gender_: _cat_, _dog_, _parent_; one denoting a
sexless object is in the _neuter gender_: _river_, _wind_,
_mountain_.

b. In Latin only nouns that denote persons and some animals have
natural gender: *nauta*, _sailor_ (masc.); *māter*, _mother_
(fem.). All others have an arbitrary gender, called _grammatical
gender_, determined chiefly by the ending: *flūmen*, _river_
(neut.); *ventus*, _wind_ (masc.); *nūbēs*, _cloud_ (fem.).

COMPARISON

XXVI. a. English adjectives and adverbs are inflected to show
degree. This is called _comparison_. There are three degrees of
comparison, the _positive_, the _comparative_, and the
_superlative_: positive _wise_, comparative _wiser_, superlative
_wisest_; positive _good_, comparative _better_, superlative
_best_; positive _often_, comparative _oftener_, superlative
_oftenest_.

b. Adjectives and adverbs are also compared in English by
prefixing the adverbs _more_ and _most_: _beautiful_, _more
beautiful_, _most beautiful_.

c. Comparison in Latin is indicated exactly as in English:
*sapiēns*, *sapientior*, *sapientissimus*; *bonus*, *melior*,
*optimus*; *idōneus*, *magis idōneus*, *maximē idōneus*; *saepe*,
*saepis*, *saepissimē*.

CONJUGATION

XXVII. a. The inflection of a verb is called _conjugation_. Verbs
are conujugated to show voice, mood, and tense, and the number
and person of the subject.

b. The English verb has but few changes of form. Thus the verb
_love_ has in common use only the forms _love_, _loves_,
_loving_, and _loved_. Most of the conjugation of the verb is
made up of verb phrases formed by the use of auxiliaries (IV, f):
_I am loved_, _I shall love_, _I shall have been loved_, etc.

c. The Latin verb has many changes in form to show voice, mood,
tense, number, and person: *amor*, _I am loved_; *amābō*, _I
shall love_; *amātus erō*, _I shall have been loved_.

_Voice_

XXVIII. A verb is in the _active voice_ when it represents the
subject as acting (or being): _The man *praised* the boy_, *vir
puerum _laudāvit_*. A verb is in the _passive voice_ when it
represents the subject as acted on: _The boy *was praised* by the
man_, *puer ā virō _laudātus est_*.

_Mood_

XXIX. A verb is in the _indicative mood_ when it is used in
stating a fact or in asking a question: _The citizens *are
assembling*_, *cīvēs _conveniunt_*; _why *do* they *carry* arms?_
*cūr arma _portant_?*

XXX. a. In English a verb is in the _subjunctive mood_ when it
asserts something doubtfully or conditionally. It is used in
subordinate clauses, and is usually introduced by _if_, _though_,
and the like: _If he *were* here, I should be glad_; _"Though he
*slay* me, yet will I trust in him."_

NOTE. The subjunctive is very little used in modern English, its
place being taken by the indicative.

b. In Latin the subjunctive has a great variety of uses, in
independent as well as in dependent clauses (344, 358, 373,
etc.).

XXXI. a. A verb is in the _imperative mood_ when it expresses
command, request, or entreaty: _*Fortify* the city_, *urbem
_mūnīte_*.

b. Unless emphatic the subject of the imperative (_thou_ or
_you_) is not expressed either in English or in Latin.

_The Infinitive_

XXXII. a. The _infinitive_ in English (_to love_, _to have
loved_, etc.) is a verbal noun. It has neither person nor number.
Like a noun it may be the subject or the object or the complement
of a verb: _*To see* is *to believe*_; _he wishes *to go* home_.
Like a verb it may have a subject, an object, and adverbial
modifiers: _We wish *you* to being your *work early*_.

b. The Latin infinitive is used in the same way that the English
infinitive is used. It differs, however, from the English
infinitive in not being used in prose in expressions of purpose
(_They came *to see* me), and in being used constantly for the
verb of a statement that is given indirectly: _He said that *he
would come*_, *dīxit _se ventūrum esse_*.

c. The verbal noun in _-ing_ is sometimes called an infinitive:
_*Seeing* is *believing*_ = _to see is to believe_. This verbal
noun has its counterpart in the Latin gerund (459).

_Tense_

XXXIII. a. A verb is in the _present_, _past_ (_imperfect_), or
_future_ tense according as it represents an action as taking
place in present, past, or future time: _I love_, _I loved (was
loving)_, _I shall love_; *amō*, *amābam*, *amābō*.

b. The _present perfect_ (_perfect_) tense represents an action
completed in the present: _I have loved_, *amāvī*; the _past
perfect_ (_pluperfect_) an action completed in the past before
some other past action or state: _I had loved_, *amāveram*; and
the _future perfect_ an action completed in the future before
some other future action or state: _I shall have loved_,
*amāverō*.

_The Participle_

XXXIV. a. The _participle_ is a verbal adjective. Like an
adjective it may qualify a noun: _*struggling* soldiers_,
*mīlitēs _labōrantēs*. Like a verb it may have an object and
adverbial modifiers: _Fearing *danger* they remained in the
camp_, *_perīculum_ veritī in castrīs mānsērunt*.

b. There are in English three participles in the active voice:
present, _loving_; past, _loved_; perfect, _having loved_; and
three in the passive voice: present, _(being) loved_; past,
_loved_; perfect, _having been loved_. In Latin the past and
perfect active and the present passive participles are wanting,
but there is a future participle.

c. The participle in _-ing_ is used with the auxiliary _be_ to
make the progressive form of the verb: _you *are loving*_, _he
*was loving*_, _they *will be loving*_. Latin has no special
tenses for the progressive forms.



TO THE BEGINNER IN LATIN

*What Latin is.* Latin is the language that was used by the
ancient Romans. It gets its name from the _Lati'ni_, a little
tribe living in western Italy more than twenty-five hundred years
ago. The Latini, and their successors, the Romans, slowly
extended their lands and their power until they gained control of
all Italy, and finally of all the civilized world of those days.
Their dominions reached from the Atlantic Ocean to Persia and
from the Baltic Sea to the deserts of Africa, and their language
was spoken wherever they ruled. For about six hundred years the
Romans were the most powerful nation on the earth. Their history
covers in all a period of twelve centuries; no nation has had a
longer history.

*Why Latin is studied.* And now why is it that it is worth your
while to study a language that is so many centuries old?

First, a knowledge of Latin helps you to use English more
correctly. As more than half the words in the English language
are of Latin origin, you yourself in a sense speak Latin to-day.
There are the words of your everyday talk, like _animal_; there
are the learned words, like _emancipate_; there are the terms of
law, of medicine, and of the sciences, like _mandamus_,
_delirium_, and _antennae_; and there are the words which are
newly come into use, like _tractor_. If you study Latin, you will
be helped to know the meaning of many of these words, how to
spell them, and how to use them correctly; all of which is quite
worth your while, particularly if you are intending to enter one
of the professions.

Again, the study of Latin will train you mind. Latin is somewhat
unlike English in the form of its words and much unlike English
in the order of words in its sentences. You will therefore be
obliged to look carefully, and to think carefully, and to speak
carefully whenever you try to read and to translate anything
written in Latin. But this close attention will do good to your
mind: it will train you powers of observation, of clear thinking,
and of clear expression; in fact, no other subject that you study
in school can do as much for you as can Latin toward developing
these desirable powers.

Furthermore, the reading of Latin will add to your information.
If you are to be a well-informed person, you will need to know
something about Rome and the Romans, and what they have meant in
the history of the world; and in no other way can you better come
to know and to appreciate the literature, the life, the customs,
and the civilization of the Romans than by the faithful study of
their language and of the things written in that language.

*How to study Latin.* 1. Never allow yourself to think that Latin
is not worth your best efforts or that it is too hard for you.
Industry and confidence will bring you success in this study.

2. Have a fixed hour each day for the study of your Latin. If
possible, prepare your lesson for to-morrow immediately after
reciting the lesson of to-day. Your interest will then be greater
and your mind better fitted to grasp the subject.

3. Learn each day's lesson with thoroughness. Neglect no part of
the lesson even if it seems to you unimportant.

4. Before beginning a new lesson recall what you have already
learned about the subject to be taught in the new lesson. For
example, if you are about to study a new use of one of the cases,
recall all the uses of that case which you have previously
learned.

5. Review the vocabularies regularly. A knowledge of the meanings
of the words will be a great saving of time to you, as well as a
constant encouragement. Aim to know every word you have met, and
to this end keep lists of words about the meaning of which you
are doubtful.

6. Recite the declensions and the conjugations by yourself aloud.
It will help you to remember them, and you will make better
recitations. Read the Latin sentences aloud each day.

7. Go over the new lesson slowly, and thus avoid mistakes in the
spelling of words, in their endings, and in the explanation of
Latin constructions.

8. Recall your English grammar when you are learning Latin
constructions; most of the Latin usages that you will learn in
your first year are like English usages.

9. Study the lessons as a whole. Then go back to special
difficulties. Go over the lesson again just before the recitation
and consider the troublesome parts.



INTRODUCTION

ALPHABET

1. The Latin alphabet has no _j_ or _w_. Otherwise it is the same
as the English.

2. The vowels are *a*, *e*, *i*, *o*, *u*. The other letters are
consonants.

3. The letter *i* is used both as a vowel and as a consonant.
Before a vowel in the same syllable it has the force of a
consonant and is called *i*-_consonant_. Thus in *iaciō*, _I
throw_, the first *i* is a consonant, and the second a vowel.

SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS [1]

4. The vowels are either long or short. In this book the long
vowels are marked (-); unmarked vowels are to be regarded as
short. The vowels are sounded as follows:

    *ā* like the last _a_ in _aha'_
    *ă* like the first _a_ in _aha'_
    *ē* like _e_ in _they_
    *ĕ* like _e_ in _met_
    *ī* like _i_ in _machine_
    *ĭ* like _i_ in _pin_
    *ō* like _o_ in _note_
    *ŏ* like _o_ in _obey_
    *ū* like _oo_ in _boot_
    *ŭ* like _oo_ in _foot_

5. The diphthongs are sounded as follows:

    *ae* like _ai_ in _aisle_
    *au* like _ou_ in _our_
    *ei* like _ei_ in _eight_
    *eu* like _eu_ in _feud_
    *oe* like _oi_ in _boil_
    *ui* like _we_

6. The consonants generally have the same sound as the
corresponding consonants in English. But there are the following
exceptions:

    *c* is like _c_ in _come_
    *g* is like _g_ in _get_
    *i-consonant* is like _y_ in _yet_
    *s* is like _s_ in _sun_
    *t* is like _t_ in _time_
    *v* is like _w_ in _wine_
    *x* is like _x_ in _extra_
    *bs* and *bt* are like _ps_ and _pt_
    *ch* is like _k_ in _kite_
    *gu*, *qu*, and sometimes *su* before a vowel are like _gw_,
      _qw_, and _sw_ (_u_ is not counted as a vowel)
    *ph* is like _p_
    *th* is like _t_

When a consonant is doubled (as *ll*), it should be pronounced
twice.

quis, sē. 24. mē, tē. 25 gēns, sīc. 26. vel, vir, iam.

SYLLABLES

8. A syllable consists of a vowel or a diphthong with or without
one or more consonants. Hence a word has as many syllables as it
has vowels and diphthongs: *ō-ce'-a-nus*, _ocean_.

9. When a word is divided into syllables, a single consonant
between two vowels is joined with the vowel following:
*lā-ti-tū'-dō*, _width_.

10. If there are two or more consonants between two vowels, the
first is pronounced with the preceding vowel: *im-mor-tā'-lis*,
_immortal_.

But a consonant followed by *l* or *r* is pronounced with the *l*
or *r*, except in *ll* and *rr*: *pū'-bli-cus*, _public_; when
*ll* or *rr* occurs, one *l* or one *r* is joined to the
preceding syllable, and the other to the following syllable:
*ter'-ra*, _land_.

Compound words are divided in such a way as to show the component
parts: *ab'-est* (*ab*, _away_, + *est*, _he is_), _he is away_.

11. The last syllable of a word is called the _ultima_; the one
next to the last, the _penult_; the one before the penult, the
_antepenult_.

12. A vowel is generally short before another vowel or *h*:
*pŏ-ē'-ma*, _poem_; *nĭ'-hil*, _nothing_.

13. A vowel is generally short before *nt* or *nd*, and before
final *m* or final *t*: *vo'-cănt*, _they call_; *vo-cā'-băm*, _I
was calling_.

14. A vowel is long before *nf* or *ns*: *a'-māns*, _loving_.

15. A vowel resulting from the contraction of two vowels is long:
*cō'-gō* (*co-agō*), _I bring together_.

16. The quantity of vowels other than those mentioned in the
preceding sections must be learned by observation.

QUANTITY OF SYLLABLES

17. A syllable is _long by nature_ when it contains a long vowel
or a diphthong: *vic-tō'-ri-a*, _victory_; *prae'-mi-um*,
_reward_.

18. A syllables is _short by nature_ when it does not contain a
long vowel or a diphthong: *o-pī'-ni-ō*, _opinion_.

19. A syllable is _long by position_ when it has a short vowel
followed by *x* or *z*, or by two or more consonants, unless
these two consonants are *p*, *b*, *t*, *d*, *c*, *g*, followed
by *l* or *r*; but the short vowel is still pronounced short:
*dē-trī-men'-tum*, _loss_.

ACCENT

20. Words of two syllables have the accent on the first syllable:
*pa'-ter*, _father_.

21. Words of more than two syllables have the accent on the
penult when it is long, otherwise on the antepenult:
*dē-mōn-strā'-re*, _to point out_; *ce-le'-ri-tās*, _swiftness_;
*ē-ven'-tus*, _outcome_ (cf. 19).

22. Several words, of which the commonest are *-ne*, the sign of
a question, and *-que*, _and_, are appended to other words. The
words so appended are known as enclitics. The words to which they
are appended are accented on the syllable preceding the enclitic,
whether that syllable is long or short: *a-mat'-ne?* _does he
love?_ *ar-mă-que*, _and arms_.

EXERCISE IN ACCENT AND PRONUNCIATION

23. Divide the following words into syllables, state the rule for
the accent, and then pronounce:

  1. dīvidunt, appellāre
  2. īnstitūtis, differēbāmus
  3. hūmānitāte, prōvinciā
  4. longus, animōs
  5. importābunt, bellum
  6. causīs, praecēdō
  7. fīnis, prohibitus
  8. initiō, persuāserāmus
  9. tempora, magistrātuum
  10. frāternus, conloquium

24. The following Latin version of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little
Star" may be used for practice in pronunciation, and for
illustration of the preceding statements about syllables, accent,
etc.:

  MICĀ, MICĀ

  Micā, micā, parva stella!
  Mīror quaenam sīs, tam bella!
  Splendēns ēminus in illō,
  Alba velut gemma, caelō.

  Quandō fervēns Sōl discessit,
  Nec calōre prāta pāscit,
  Mox ostendis lūmen pūrum,
  Micāns, micāns per obscūrum.

  Tibi noctū quī vagātur
  Ob scintillulam grātātur;
  Nī micārēs tū, nōn scīret
  Quās per viās errāns īret.

  Meum saepe thalamum lūce
  Speculāris cūriōsā;
  Neque carpseris sopōrem
  Dōnec vēnit Sōl per auram.

[Illustration: THE ARCH OF TITUS, SHOWING A ROMAN INSCRIPTION]

[1] Latin is pronounced to-day substantially as it was pronounced
by the Romans at the beginning of the Christian era.



LESSON I

THE SINGULAR AND PLURAL OF NOUNS AND VERBS · THE NOMINATIVE CASE
USED AS SUBJECT

25. *The Singular and Plural of Nouns and Verbs.*

  NOUN
  _Nom. Sing._ agricol*a*, _farmer_
  _Nom. Plur._ acricol*ae*, _farmers_

  VERB
  _3d Pers. Sing._ labōra*t*, _works_, _is working_, _does work_
  _3d Pers. Plur._ labōra*nt*, _work_, _are working_, _do work_

a. Observe that the distinction between the singular and the
plural is shown by the final letters of the noun and of the verb.
These final letters of a noun are called _case endings_; the
final letters of a verb are called _personal endings_.

b. Form the nominative plural of the nouns in the vocabulary, and
the third person plural of the verbs.

26. VOCABULARY

  *agri'cola*, farmer (_agriculture_)
  *Cornē'lia*, Cornelia
  *Iū'lia*, Julia
  *nau'ta*, sailor (_nautical_)
  *puel'la*, girl
  *et*, _conj._, and
  *-ne*, _enclitic, sign of a question_
  *am'bulat*, walks (_perambulate_)
  *appropin'quat*, approaches, draws near (_propinquity_)
  *can'tat*, sings (_incantation_)
  *labō'rat*, works, labors, suffers (laboratory)
  *na'tat*, swims (_natatorium_)
  *quis*, _interrog. pron._, who?
  *quid*, _interrog. pron._, what?

27. *The Nominative Case used as Subject.*

  1. *Puella cantat*, _the girl sings (is singing, does sing)._
  2. *Puellae cantant*, _the girls sing (are singing, do sing)._
  3. *Cantatne puella*, _does the girl sing (is the girl singing)?_
  4. *Cantantne puellae*, _do the girls sing (are the girls singing)?_

a. In Latin there is no article (III, b): *puella* may be
translated _girl_, _a girl_, or _the girl_; and *puellae*,
_girls_ or _the girls_.

b. What is the subject (XI, b) of each of the model sentences,
and what is the predicate (XI, c)? In what case is the subject of
a Latin verb (XXIV)?

c. Observe that the verbs agree with their subjects in number.

d. Observe that *-ne* is not separately translated. Usually it is
attached to the emphatic word in the sentence, and the emphasized
word is placed first. When an interrogative word is used, *-ne*
is omitted: see sentence 11 below. In English *-ne* is
represented on the printed page by the question mark, and in oral
translation by the inflection of the voice.

28. _*Rule for the Nominative Case as Subject.* The subject of a
verb is in the nominative case._

29. _*Rule for the agreement of the Verb with its Subject.* A

LESSON II

THE ACCUSATIVE CASE USED AS THE DIRECT OBJECT

32. *The Accusative Case used as the Direct Object.*

  1. *Nauta puellam vocat*, _the sailor calls the girl._
  2. *nautae puellās vocant*, _the sailors call the girls._

a. Observe that *puellam* is the object (XIV, a) of *vocat*, and
*puellās* of *vocant*; and that when a Latin noun is used as the
object, the case ending is not the same as when it is the subject
and so in the nominative. The case of the object in Latin is
called _accusative_ (XXIV) and not objective, as in English.

b. Form the accusative singular and plural of the nouns in
sections 26 and 34.

33. _*Rule for the Accusative as the Direct Object.* The object
of a verb is in the accusative case._

34. VOCABULARY

  *a'qua*, water (_aquatic_)
  *Gal'ba*, Galba
  *lit'tera*, letter (of the alphabet); _plur._ a letter,
    epistle (_literary_)
  *ter'ra*, land (_terrace_)
  *tu'ba*, trumpet (_tuba_)
  *a'mat*, loves, likes (_amateur_)
  *con'vocat*, calls together (_convoke_)
  *ha'bet*, has, holds (_habit_)
  *lau'dat*, praises (_laud_)
  *vi'det*, sees (_provide_)
  *quem*, _acc. of *quis*_, whom?
  *quid*, _acc. of *quid*_, what?
  *nunc*, _adv._, now

35. *Order of words.* Observe that in the model sentences (32)
the order of Latin words is unlike the order of the words in the
English sentences. The normal position of the subject of a Latin
sentence is at the beginning; that of the verb is at the end.
Variations from this order put emphasis on the word moved toward
the beginning of the sentence; thus, *puellam nauta vocat* means
that the sailor calls _a girl_. In translating Latin sentences
put the emphasis where it belongs.

EXERCISES

36. 1. Galba tubam habet. 2. Tubāsne habet Galba? 3. Puellae
Cornēliam et Iūliam laudant. 4. Litterās nauta videt. 5. Nautās

LESSON III

THE PRESENT INDICATIVE ACTIVE OF THE FIRST CONJUGATION

38. *The Four Conjucations.* Regular verbs in Latin are divided
into four classes, or conjucations (XXVII), distinguished from
one another by the stem vowel before the ending *-re* of the
present infinitive active.

                      PRESENT         PRESENT      DISTINGUISHING
                      INFINITIVE      STEM         VOWEL
  _First Conj._       amā're          amā-         *ā*
  _Second Conj._      monē're         monē-        *ē*
  _Third Conj._       re'gere         rege-        *ĕ*
  _Fourth Conj._      audī're         audī-        *ī*


39. *The Present Indicative Active of the First Conjugation.*

                SINGULAR                                   PERSONAL ENDINGS
  _1st Pers._   a'm*ō*,                                    *-ō*,
                _I love, am loving, do love_               _I_
  _2d Pers._    a'mā*s*,                                   *-s*,
                _you love, are loving, do love_            _you_
  _3d Pers._    a'ma*t*,                                   *-t*,
                _he, she, it loves, is loving, does love_  _he_, _she_, _it_

                PLURAL
  _1st Pers._   amā'*mus*,                                 *-mus*,
                _we love, are loving, do love_             _we_
  _2d Pers._    amā'*tis*,                                 *-tis*,
                _you love, are loving, do love_            _you_
  _3d Pers._    a'ma*nt*,                                  *-nt*,
                _they love, are loving, do love_           _they_

a. Observe that in *amō* the final *a* of the stem disappears,
giving *amō* instead of *amaō*. In what forms is this *a* of the
stem not long (13)?

b. When the subject of a verb is a personal pronoun, it is seldom
expressed in Latin unless emphatic. Why is the omission of the
subject possible? Translate *puellās convocātis* and *nautam
vident*.

c. Inflect like *amō* the present indicative active of *ambulō*,
*appropinquō*, *cantō*, *convocō*, labōrō*, *laudō*, and *natō*.

40. VOCABULARY

  *dō*, _pres. stem *dă-* (the *a* of *dō* is regularly short,
    but long in *dās*), give (_dative_)
  *in'cola*, inhabitant
  *sae'pe*, _adv._, often
  *sed*, _conj._, but
  *spec'tō*, _pres. stem *spectā-*_, look at (_spectator_)

EXERCISES

41. 1. Ambulat, convocat, cantat. 2. Convocantne? cantantne?
laudantne? 3. Natās, labōrās, ambulās. 4. Amāmus, appropinquāmus,
ambulāmus. 5. Convocātis, cantātis, amātis. 6. Amant, dat,

sing, does she praise? 3. They are approaching, they give, you
walk. 4. You are praising, they swim, he does labor. 5. We call
together the inhabitants, but you call together the sailors. 6.
The girls are now looking at the water.

LESSON IV

THE GENITIVE CASE USED TO DENOTE POSSESSION

43. *The Genitive Case used to denote Posession*

  1. *Fīliae Galbae cantant*, _the daughters of Galba sing_, or
     _Galba's daughters sing_
  2. *Fīliās nautārum laudāmus*, _we praise the daughters of the
     sailors_, or _we praise the sailors' daughters_.

a. Observe that *Galbae* modifies *fīliae* and tells whose
daughters are singing. In the same way *nautārum* modifies
*fīliās* and tells whose daughters we are praising. This usage of
*Galbae* and of *nautārum* is like that of the English possessive
case (XXIV, a, 2). In Latin the case thus used is called the
_genitive_ (XXIV, b), and this usage of that case is called the
_Genitive of Possession_.

b. Observe the case endings of the genitive. Form the genitive
singular and the genitive plural of the nouns in sections 26, 34,
and 45.

c. Note the translations given to the genitives in the model
sentences. Translate *fīlia agricolae* and *fīliae agricolārum*.

d. The genitive normally stands after the word it modifies.

44. _*Rule for the Genitive of Possession.* The word denoting the
owner or possessor is in the genitive case._

45. VOCABULARY

  *fē'mina*, woman (_feminine_)
  *fī'lia*, daughter (_filial_)
  *fortū'na*, fortune (_fortunate_)
  *poē'ta*, poet (_poetic_)
  *rēgī'na*, queen
  *cu'ius*, _gen. of *quis* and of *quid*_, of whom? whose? of
    what?
  *dēlec'tō*, _pres. stem *dēlectā-*_, delight, please
    (_delectable_)
  *exspec'tō*, _pres. stem *exspectā-*, wait, wait for (_expect_)
  *fu'gō*, _pres. stem *fugā-*_, put to flight, rout
  *lī'berō*, _pres. stem *līberā-*_, set free, free (_liberate_)
  *por'tō*, _pres. stem *portā-*_, carry, bring (_portable_)
  *et'iam*, _adv._, even

EXERCISES

46. 1. Dēlectat, fugāmus, līberās. 2. Exspectāmus, portant,
dēlectās. 3. Dēlectāmus, fugātis, līberant. 4. Līberatne? līberō,
portāmus. 5. Fīliās incolārum līberant. 6. Poētae fortūna rēgīnam
dēlectat. 7. Spectāmus fīliās fēminae. 8. Fīliane Galbae litterās
exspectat? 9. Etiam tubae nautārum incolās fugant. 10. Cuius
litterās portās?

LESSON V

THE PRESENT INDICATIVE ACTIVE OF THE SECOND CONJUGATION · CAUSAL
CLAUSE WITH _QUOD_

48. *The Present Indicative Active of the Second Conjugation.*

  SINGULAR

  _1st Pers._ mo'ne*ō*,  _I advise, am advising, do advise_
  _2d Pers._  mo'nē*s*,  _you advise, are advising, do advise
  _3d Pers._  mo'ne*t*,  _he, she, it advises, is advising, does advise_

  PLURAL

  _1st Pers._ monē'*mus* _we advise, are advising, do advise_
  _2d Pers._  monē'*tis* _you advise, are advising, do advise_
  _3d Pers._  mo'ne*nt*  _they advise, are advising, do advise_

a. What verbs belong to the second conjugation (38)?

b. Observe that to the stem *monē-* the same personal endings are
added to inflect *moneō* that were added to the stem *amā-* to
inflect *amō*. Observe the three forms in which the present tense
has the *e* of the stem not marked long. Compare the forms of the
present tense of *amō* (39).

c. To the stems *docē-*, *habē-*, *terrē-*, and *vidē-* add the
personal endings and thus inflect their present indicative
active.

49. VOCABULARY

  *pecū'nia*, money (_pecuniary_)
  *pīrā'ta*, pirate (_piratical_)
  *prae'da*, booty, plunder (_predatory_)
  *cūr*, _adv._, why?

  *mo'neō*, *monēre*, advise, warn (_admonition_)
  *ter'reō*, *terrēre*, scare, frighten (_terror_)
  *vi'deō*, *vidēre*, see (_improvident_)
  *quod*, _conj._, because

50. *Causal Clause.* For the kinds of clauses in a complex
sentense see XIX, XX.

  *Incolās monet quod pīrātae appropinquant*, _he warns the
    inhabitants because the pirates are approaching.

a. Observe that *quod* introduces a dependent clause, which tells
the reason, or cause, of what is stated in the independent part
of the sentence. Such a *quod* clause is called a _causal
clause_.

51. _*Rule for a Causal Clause with Quod.* The cause of an action
may be expressed by a dependent clause introduced by *quod*._

EXERCISES

52. 1. Pecūniam habēs. 2. Iūliam doceō. 3. Incolās saepe monēs.
4. Puellāsne terrent? 5. Quem vident? 6. Monēmus et docēmus. 7.
Quid habēmus? 8. Praedam nunc videō. 9. Tubam vidētis. 10.

LESSON VI

THE DATIVE CASE USED AS THE INDIRECT OBJECT · THE ABLATIVE USED
IN PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES TO SHOW PLACE WHERE

54. *The Dative and Ablative Cases.* Besides the three cases that
you have already studied, there are in Latin in common use two
other cases, the _dative_ and the _ablative_. For the general
character of these cases see XXIV, a, 4; b.

55. VOCABULARY

  *do'mina*, lady, mistress (of slaves) (_dominant_)
  *fā'bula*, story (_fable_)
  *īn'sula*, island (_peninsula_)
  *vi'a*, way, road, street (_viaduct_)
  *in*, _prep. with abl._, in, on
  *dēmōn'strō*, *dēmōnstrāre*, point out, show (_demonstrate_)
  *ha'bitō*, *habitāre*, dwell, live (_inhabitant_)
  *ma'neō*, *manēre*, remain (_mansion_)
  *nār'rō*, *nārrāre*, tell, relate (_narrator_)
  *cui*, _dat. of *quis* and of *quid*_, to whom? for whom? to
    what? for what?

56. *The Dative used as Indirect Object.*

  *Cornēliae et puellīs fābulam nārrō*, _I am telling a story to
    Cornelia and the girls_, or _I am telling Cornelia and the
    girls a story_.

a. Observe that what is being told is a story, *fābulam*, the
direct object; and that the _persons to whom_ the story is told
are _Cornelia_ and the _girls_. *Cornēliae* and *puellīs*,
therefore, are in the dative case, as this is the case which
expresses the relation of _to_ or _for_ (XXIV, b). This usage,
which is like the English (XXIV, a, 4), is called the _Dative of
the Indirect Object_.

b. The case endings of the dative are *-ae*, singular, and *-īs*,
plural. Form the dative, singular and plural, of the nouns in
sections 26, 34, and 55.

57. _*Rule for the Dative of the Indirect Object.* The indirect
object of a verb is in the dative case._

58. *The Ablative used in Prepositional Phrases to show Place
Where.*

  *In terrā et in īnsulīs habitant*, _they live on the land and
    on the islands_.

a. Observe taht the phrases (XVI, a) _on the land_, *in terrā*,
and _on the islands_, *in īnsulīs*, show _place where_. *Terrā*
and *īnsulīs* are in the ablative case (XXIV, b).

b. The case endings of the ablative are *-ā*, singular, and
*-īs*, plural.

c. Form the ablative, singular and plural, of the nouns in
sections 26, 34, and 55.

59. _*Rule for the Ablative of Place Where.* Place where is
commonly expressed by a phrase consisting of a preposition,
usually *in*, with the ablative case._

60. *Order of Words.* The indirect object normally stands before
the direct object. An ablative normally stands before the direct
object. An ablative normally stands before the direct object.
Variations from this order give emphasis to the word removed from
its normal position.

EXERCISES

61. 1. Agricola dominae viam dēmōnstrat. 2. Puellīs etiam
Cornēlia fābulam nārrat. 3. In īnsulā habitāmus. 4. Quis poētis
īnsulam dēmōnstrat? 5. Cūr pirātae in aquā manent? 6. Cui
pecūniam dās? 7. Nautae agricolīs praedam dēmōnstrant. 8. Incolae
in viīs appropinquant et rēgīnam spectant. 9. Dominam amant quod
fābulās nārrat.

62. 1. To whom are you pointing out the lady? 2. I am pointing
out the letter to Julia. 3. They are telling stories to the
queen. 4. Galba's daughter gives money to the sailors. 5. Do the
pirates live on the island? 6. Whose daughters are approaching in
the street?



LESSON VII

THE FIRST DECLENSION · GENDER

63. *The First Declension.* There are five declensions (XXII) of
Latin nouns. Those nouns which end in *-a* are in the nominative
singular and in *-ae* in the genitive singular are said to belong
to the _first declension_. Learn the complete inflection of the
noun *agricola*:

         SINGULAR                                    CASE ENDINGS
  _Nom._ agri'col*a*                                 *-a*
  _Gen._ agri'col*ae*                                *-ae*
  _Dat._ agri'col*ae*                                *-ae*
  _Acc._ agri'col*am*                                *-am*
  _Abl._ agri'col*ā*                                 *-ā*

         PLURAL
  _Nom._ agri'col*ae*                                *-ae*
  _Gen._ agricol*ā'rum*                              *-ārum*
  _Dat._ agri'col*īs*                                *-īs*
  _Acc._ agri'col*ās*                                *-ās*
  _Abl._ agri'col*īs*                                *-īs*

a. Observe that the inflection of a noun consists merely in
adding the case endings to an unchangeable part of the word. This
unchangeable part is called the _base_. Decline like *agricola*
the nouns in section 55.

64. *Gender.* Latin nouns are masculine, feminine, or neuter in
gender (XXV, a, b).

a. Nouns of the first declension are feminine unless they denote
males. *Nauta*, *agricola*, *Galba*, *poēta*, and *pīrāta* are
the masculine nouns you have learned. Hereafter the gender of
nouns will be shown in the vocabularies by the letters _m._,
_f._, or _n._.

65. VOCABULARY

  *dīligen'tia*, *-ae*, _f._, diligence (_diligent_)
  *fu'ga*, *-ae*, _f._, flight, rout (_refuge_)
  *Germā'nia*, *-ae*, _f._, Germany (_Germanic_)
  *Grae'cia*, *-ae*, _f._, Greece (_Grecian_)
  *Ita'lia*, *-ae*, _f._, Italy (_Italian_)
  *por'ta*, *-ae*, _f._, gate (_portal_)
  *prōvin'cia*, *-ae*, _f._, province (_provincial_)
  *pug'na*, *-ae*, _f._, fight (_pugnacious_)
  *sil'va*, *-ae*, _f._, woods, forest (_silvan_)
  *victō'ria*, *-ae*, _f._, victory (_victorious_)

a. The ending *-ae* of the genitive singular is placed after the
nouns in the vocabulary to indicate that these nouns belong to
the first declension.

EXERCISES

66. 1. Cūr poētae in silvīs manent? 2. Cui victōriam rēgīnae
nārrās? 3. In portā Iūliam et Cornēliam videō. 4. In Germāniā et
in Graeciā saepe agricolās convocant. 5. Habitantne in prōvinciā?
6. Victōria nautārum agricolās terret. 7. Dīligentia puellārum

LESSON VIII

THE SECOND DECLENSION

73. *The Second Declension.* Most nouns of the second declension
end in *-us* or *-um*. Those ending in *-us* are generally
masculine; those in *-um* are neuter. *Hortus*, _garden_, and
*dōnum*, _gift_, are inflected as follows:

  SINGULAR

                        CASE ENDINGS                  CASE ENDINGS
  _Nom._  hor't*us*     *-us*           dō'n*um*      *-um*
  _Gen._  hor't*ī*      *-ī*            dō'n*ī*       *-ī*
  _Dat._  hor't*ō*      *-ō*            dō'n*ō*       *-ō*

  _Abl._  hor't*ō*      *-ō*            dō'n*ō*       *-ō*

  PLURAL

  _Nom._  hor't*ī*      *-ī*            dō'n*a*       *-a*
  _Gen._  hort*ō'rum*   *-ōrum*         dōn*ō'rum*    *-ōrum*
  _Dat._  hor't*īs*     *-īs*           dō'n*īs*      *-īs*
  _Acc._  hor't*ōs*     *-ōs*           dō'n*a*       *-a*
  _Abl._  hor't*īs*     *-īs*           dō'n*īs*      *-īs*

a. Learn the case endings first. Then learn the inflection by
adding the case endings to the base of each noun. Then practice
the inflection of the nouns in section 74.

b. What do you notice about the dative and the ablative plural of
the first and second declensions? What cases are alike in the
second declension?

74. VOCABULARY

  *amī'cus*, *-ī*, _m._, friend (_amicable_)

LESSON IX

ADJECTIVES OF THE FIRST AND SECOND DECLENSIONS

77. *Adjectives in Latin.* Latin adjectives, unlike English
adjectives, are declined (XXII). There are two declensions of
adjectives.

78. *Adjectives of the First and Second Declensions.* One class
of adjectives has in its masculine and neuter forms the case
endings of the second declension, and in its feminine forms the
case endings of the first declension: as, *bonus* (masc.), *bona*
(fem.), *bonum* (neut.), _good_. Learn the full declension of
*bonus* (643).

79. _*Rule for the Agreement of Adjectives.* Adjectives agree
with their nouns in gender, number, and case._

          MASCULINE         FEMININE            NEUTER
  _Nom._  hort*us* bon*us*  puell*a* bon*a*     dōn*um* bon*um*
  _Gen._  hort*ī* bon*ī*    puell*ae* bon*ae*   dōn*ī* bon*ī*
  _Dat._  hort*ō* bon*ō*    puell*ae* bon*ae*   dōn*ō* bon*ō*
          etc.              etc.                etc.

a. Complete the declension of the expressions given above.
Decline together *amīcus bonus*, _good friend_; *fābula grāta*,
_pleasing story_; *oppidum magnum*, _large town_.

80. The rule given in 79 does not mean that adjectives must have
the same case endings as the nouns they modify. An adjective
modifying a masculine noun of the first declension will not have
the same case endings as the noun. Thus,

          SINGULAR                PLURAL
  _Nom._  naut*a* bon*us*         naut*ae* bon*ī*
  _Gen._  naut*ae* bon*ī*         naut*ārum* bon*ōrum*
  _Dat._  naut*ae* bon*ō*         naut*īs* bon*īs*
          etc.                    etc.

a. Complete the declension of *nauta bonus*. Decline *poēta
grātus*, _pleasing poet_.

81. *Order of Words.* An adjective normally follows the noun
which it modifies.

82. VOCABULARY

  *car'rus*, *-ī*, _m._, wagon, cart (_car_)
  *ci'bus*, *-ī*, _m._, food
  *pī'lum*, *-ī*, _n._, javelin
  *rē'mus*, *-ī*, _m._, oar (_trireme_)
  *ven'tus*, *-ī*, _m._, wind (_ventilate_)
  *pro'bō*, *probāre*, approve, approve of (_approbation_)
  *bo'nus*, *bo'na*, *bo'num*, good, kind (_bonus_)
  *grā'tus*, *grā'ta*, *grā'tum*, pleasing, welcome (_gratitude_)
  *mag'nus*, *mag'na*, *mag'num*, great, large (_magnitude_)
  *va'lidus*, *va'lida*, *va'lidum*, strong, robust (_valid_)
  *at'que*, _conj._, and also
  *nōn*, _adv._, not (_nonexistent_)
  *ubi*, _adv._, where? (_ubiquitous_)

LESSON X

THE PRESENT INDICATIVE OF _SUM_ · PREDICATE NOUN AND PREDICATE
ADJECTIVE

85. *The Present Indicative of _Sum_.* The irregular verb *sum*,
_I am_, is conjugated in the present indicative as follows:

                SINGULAR                  PLURAL
  _1st Pers._   su*m*, _I am_             su'*mus*, _we are_
  _2d Pers._    e*s*, _you are_           es'*tis*, _you are_
  _3d Pers._    es*t*, _he, she, it is_   su*nt*, _they are_

86. *Predicate Noun and Predicate Adjective.* For the definition
of a predicate noun and of a predicate adjective, see XV.

  1. *Mārcus est agricola*, _Marcus is a farmer_.
  2. *Nautae sunt amīcī*, _the sailors are friends_.
  3. *Hortus est magnus*, _the garden is large_.
  4. *Puellae sunt grātae*, _the girls are welcome_.

a. Observe the case of *agricola*, *amīcī*, *magnus*, and
*grātae* (XV, c).

87. _*Rule for the Agreement of a Predicate Noun.* A predicate
noun agrees in case with the subject of the verb._

88. _*Rule for the Agreement of a Predicate Adjective.* A
predicate adjective agrees in gender, number, and case with the
subject of the verb._

89. *Order of Words.* The verb *sum* generally has no emphasis
(unless it begins the sentence), and it is placed in the sentence
where it sounds best or where it adds clearness.

In Latin phrases consisting of a monosyllabic preposition,
adjective, and noun the order of the words is often adjective,
preposition, noun: as, *magnō in oppidō*, _in the large town_.

a. Observe that *tribūnus* denotes the same person as *Galba*,
and is joined to *Galba* as a descriptive or explanatory noun;
and that *amīcum* is related in the same way to *Mārcum*. Such
words are called _appositives_.

LESSON XII

THE SECOND DECLENSION: NOUNS IN _-ER_, _-IR_, _-IUS_, AND _-IUM_

97. *Nouns of the Second Declension in _-er_ and _-ir_.* Some
nouns of the second delcension end in *-er* and *-ir*. They are
slightly different from *hortus* in their inflection:

  SINGULAR

  _Nom._  pu'er             a'ger             vir
  _Gen._  pu'er*ī*          a'gr*ī*           vi'r*ī*
  _Dat._  pu'er*ō*          a'gr*ō*           vi'r*ō*
  _Acc._  pu'er*um*         a'gr*um*          vi'r*um*
  _Abl._  pu'er*ō*          a'gr*ō*           vi'r*ō*

  PLURAL

  _Nom._  pu'er*ī*          a'gr*ī*           vi'r*ī*

  _Abl._  pu'er*īs*         a'gr*īs*          vi'r*īs*

a. Observe that these nouns are declined in the same way as
*hortus* except that they lack the ending *-us* in the nominative
singular. *Ager* is like *puer* except that *e* before *r* occurs
only in the nominative singular.

98. *Nouns of the Second Declension in _-ius_ and _-ium_.* Nouns
of the second declension ending in *-ius* and *-ium* contract the
genitive ending *-iī* to *-ī*. The accent remains on the same
syllable as in the nominative: *auxi'lium*, gen. *auxi'lī*. Learn
the declension of *fīlius* and *proelium* (637).

99. *Gender of Nouns of the Second Declension.* Nouns of the
second declension ending in *-um* are neuter; most others are
masculine.

100. VOCABULARY

  *a'ger*, *agrī*, _m._, field (_agriculture_) [1]

LESSON XIII

ADJECTIVES OF THE FIRST AND SECOND DECLENSIONS ENDING IN _-ER_

103. *Adjectives of the First and Second Declensions in _-er_.*
Some adjectives of the first and second declensions end in *-er*
in the nominative singular masculine. Their inflection resembles
that of *puer* and of *ager*.

a. Learn the declension of *līber* and *noster* (643).

b. Observe that *līber* retains the *e* in all forms, as *puer*
does, while *noster*, like *ager*, has no *e* after the
nominative.

c. Decline *mister*, _wretched_, like *līber*. The other
adjectives in this book that end in *-er* are declined like
*noster*.

d. Decline together *vir līber*, _free man_; *fēmina misera*,
_poor woman_; *bellum miserum*, _wretched war_; *poēta līber*,

LESSON XIV

THE IMPERFECT AND FUTURE INDICATIVE OF _SUM_ · THE DATIVE WITH
ADJECTIVES

108. *The Imperfect Indicative of _Sum_.* The imperfect
indicative of *sum* is inflected as follows:

     SINGULAR                               PLURAL
  1. e'ra*m*, _I was                        erā'*mus*, _we were_
  2. e'rā*s*, _you were_                    erā'*tis*, _you were_
  3. e'ra*t*, _he, she, it was_             e'ra*nt*, _they were_


109. *The Future Indicative of _Sum_.* The future indicative of
*sum* is inflected as follows:

     SINGULAR                               PLURAL

110. *The Dative with Adjectives.*

  *Dōnum puerō erit grātum*, _the gift will be pleasing to the
    boy_.

a. Observe that *puerō* is translated with the adjective
*grātum*, _pleasing to the boy_. Certain Latin adjectives,
particularly those meaning _near_, _fit_, _friendly_, _pleasing_,
_like_, and their opposites, are thus followed by the case
expressing _to_ or _for_, exactly as they are followed in English
by a phrase beginning with _to_ or _for_: as, _fit for war_,
_unfriendly to us_. This usage is known as the _Dative with
Adjectives_.

111. _*Rule for the Dative with Adjectives.* Certain adjectives
meaning *near*, *fit*, *friendly*, *pleasing*, *like*, and their
opposites, may be accompanied by a dative to show the person or
the thing toward which the quality of the adjective is directed._

[2] a great battle in Britain. 9. The books will certainly be
welcome to my friend Marcus.

[1] The predicate adjective *idōnea* is neuter because the two
subjects are things without life.

[2] Express _there will be_ by *erit*, and place *erit* at the
beginning of the sentence. How do you say _there are_? _there
is_? _there were_?

LESSON XV

THE IMPERFECT INDICATIVE ACTIVE, FIRST AND SECOND CONJUGTIONS ·
THE ABLATIVE OF MEANS

120. *The Imperfect Indicative Active, First and Second
Conjugations.* The imperfect indicative active of the first and
second conjugations is inflected as follows:

     SINGULAR                         PLURAL
  1. amā'ba*m*, _I was loving_        amābā'*mus*, _we were loving_
  2. amā'bā*s*, _you were loving_     amābā'*tis*, _you were loving_
  3. amā'ba*t*, _he was loving_       amā'ba*nt*, _they were loving_

     SINGULAR                         PLURAL
  1. monē'ba*m*, _I was adivising_    monēbā'*mus*, _we were advising_
  2. monē'bā*s*, _you were advising_  monēbā'*tis*, _you were advising_
  3. monē'ba*t*, _he was adivising_   monē'ba*nt*, _they were advising_

a. Observe that in this tense the personal ending of the first
person singular is *-m*, not *-ō*.

b. Observe that *amābam* is formed by adding to the stem *amā-*
the tense sign *-bā-*, and to that tense sign the personal
endings: *amā-ba-m*, etc. Divide *monēbam* into three parts in
the same way.

c. Inflect the imperfect of the verbs in 68 and 115.

d. The imperfect tense expresses action going on in past time.

121. *The Ablative of Means.*

  *Rōmānī gladiīs et pīlīs pugnābant*, _the Romans were fighting
    with swords and javelins_.

a. Observe that *gladiīs* and *pīlīs* are in the ablative, since
they express the relations of _with_ and _by_. They answer the
questions _with what?_ _by means of what?_ The ablative so used
is called the _Ablative of Means_. It is limited to nouns that
denote things, and is translated by a phrase beginning with _by_,
_with_, or _by means of_.

122. _*Rule for the Ablative of Means.* The means by which an
action is accomplished is expressed by the ablative without a
preposition (XXIV, b).

123. VOCABULARY

  *ar'mō*, *armāre*, arm, equip (_armor_)
  *com'pleō*, *complēre*, fill (_complete_)
  *dēfes'sus*, *-a*, *-um*, tired out, weary

amīcum meum, vocābam. 11. Pīlīs tribūnum et lēgātum in pugnā
superābant. 12. Deīs dōna vestra erunt grāta. 13. Vīcus proximus
ōceanō erat.

125. 1. I was walking, but you (_sing._) were waiting in the
field. 2. We were arming, they were remaining. 3. You (_plur._)
were approaching, and they were fighting. 4. He was working in
the village. 5. We were teaching by means of stories and books.
6. With your swords you were liberating your friends. 7. Food was
welcome to the tired Helvetians. 8. The men were fighting with
long javelins. 9. The lieutenant was filling the village with
food and grain.



LESSON XVI

THE FUTURE INDICATIVE ACTIVE, FIRST AND SECOND CONJUGATIONS · THE
ABLATIVE OF MANNER

126. *The Future Indicative Active, First and Second
Conjugations.* The future indicative active of the first and
second conjugations is inflected as follows:

    SINGULAR                       PLURAL
  1. amā'b*ō*, _I shall love_       amā'bi*mus*, _we shall love_
  2. amā'bi*s*, _you will love_     amā'bi*tis*, _you will love_
  3. amā'bi*t*, _he will love_      amā'bu*nt*, _they will love_

    SINGULAR                       PLURAL
  1. monē'b*ō*, _I shall advise_    monē'bi*mus*, _we shall advise_
  2. monē'bi*s*, _you will advise_  monē'bi*tis*, _you will advise_
  3. monē'bi*t*, _he will advise_   monē'bu*nt*, _they will advise_

a. Observe that the future of *amō* is formed by adding to the
stem *amā-* the tense sign *-bi-*, and to the tense sign the
personal endings; but the *i* is dropped in the first person, and
in the third person plural is changed to *u*.

  1. How is the future of *moneō* formed?

b. Inflect the future of the verbs in 68 and 115.

127. VOCABULARY

  *aedi'ficō*, *aedificāre*, build (_edifice_)
  *ae'ger*, *ae'gra*, *ae'grum*, sick
  *cum*, _prep. with abl._, with
  *cū'ra*, *-ae*, _f._, care, anxiety (_curator_)
  *in*, _prep. with acc._, into, to
  *nāvi'gium*, *nāvi'gī*, _n._, boat
  *pro'perō*, *properāre*, hasten
  *quō*, _adv._, whither?
  *stu'dium*, *studī*, _n._, zeal, eagerness (_study_)
  *te'neō*, *tenēre*, hold, keep (_tenant_)

128. *The Ablative of Manner.*

  1. *Mārcus cum studiō labōrat*, _Marcus works with zeal
    (zealously)_.
  2. *Mārcus magnō cum studiō labōrat*, _Marcus works with great
    zeal_.
  3. *Mārcus magnō studiō labōrat*, _Marcus works with great
    zeal_.

a. Observe that _manner_ is expressed in these sentences by the
use of the ablative case. Observe that 2 and 3 are translated in
the same way, and that *cum* may be omitted when there is an
adjective in the phrase. The ablative thus used answers the
questions _how?_ _in what way?_ _in what manner?_ and is called
the _Ablative of Manner_. The ablative of manner may often be
translated by an adverb: *cum studiō*, _zealously_.

129. _*Rule for the Ablative of Manner.* The ablative with *cum*
is used with abstract nouns (1, f) to denote the manner of an
action; but *cum* may be omitted if an adjective modifies the
noun of the phrase._

EXERCISES

130. 1. Vocābunt, complēbunt, properābunt. 2. Armābitne?
superābit, tenēbimus. 3. Manēbuntne? dēmōnstrābimus, terrēbō. 4.

7. He will hasten into Greece and also will arm the inhabitants.
8. Where will our friends fight zealously? 9. The men were
diligently filling the boats.



LESSON XVII

PRINCIPAL PARTS · THE PERFECT STEM · THE PERFECT INDICATIVE
ACTIVE, FIRST CONJUGATION

132. *Principal Parts.* The principal parts of the verb *amō* are
as follows:

  PRES. IND. ACT.  PRES. INF. ACT.  PERF. IND. ACT.  PERF. PASS. PART.
  *amō*            *amāre*          *amāvī*          *amātus*

a. The principal parts of the verb are so called because all
forms of the verb can be made from them, or from the three stems
shown in the principal parts. These three stems are as follows:

  1. Present stem: *amā-*, found by dropping the *-re* of the
    present indicative active.
  2. Perfect stem: *amāv-*, found by dropping the personal ending
    *-ī* of the first person singular of the perfect indicative
    active.
  3. Participial stem: *amāt-*, found by dropping the nominative
    ending *-us* of the perfect passive participle.

133. *The Perfect Stem.* By the use of the present stem you have
conjugated the present, imperfect, and future tenses. By the use
of the perfect stem *amāv-* the perfect, pluperfect, and future
perfect tenses are conjugated.

134. *The Perfect Indicative Active of the First Conjugation.*
The perfect indicative active of *amō* is inflected as follows:

                                            PERSONAL ENDINGS OF
  SINGULAR                                  PERFECT TENSE
  1. amā'v*ī*, _I have loved, I loved_      *-ī*
  2. amāv*is'tī*, _you have loved_, etc.    *-istī*
  3. amā'v*it*, _he has loved_, etc.        *-it*

  PLURAL
  1. amā'v*imus*, _we have loved_, etc.     *-imus*
  2. amāv*is'tis*, _you have loved_, etc.   *-istis*
  3. amāv*ē'runt*, _they have loved_, etc.  *-ērunt*

a. Observe that the perfect tense has two meanings: _I have
loved_ and _I loved_. Both express completed action. _I have
loved_ indicates that the action is completed at the present
time; and the perfect tense so used is known as the _perfect
definite_. _I loved_ indicates merely that the action was
completed at some indefinite time in the past; and the perfect
tense so used is known as the _perfect indefinite_. The imperfect
tense, in contrast with the perfect, expresses an action going on
in the past (120, d).

b. Give the principal parts of each verb of the first conjugation
in 68 and 115; they are formed in the same way as those of *amō*
(except *dō*, *dare*, *dedī*, *datus*). Inflect the perfect tense
of each.

EXERCISES

135. 1. Vocāvitne? convocāvit, superāvit. 2. Pugnāvērunt,
exspectāvērunt, labōrāvērunt. 3. Properāvimus, aedificāvimus,
armāvimus. 4. Laudāvīne? vocāvistī, properāvistis. 5. Portāvis,
dēlectāvit, dedit.

136. 1. You have praised, you showed, you related. 2. I have
given, I brought, I set free. 3. They approved, they have sung,
they swam. 4. We gave, we dwelt, we showed.

137. VOCABULARY

  *ar'ma*, *-ōrum*, _n. plur._, arms
  *di'ū*, _adv._, for a long time, long
  *prō*, _prep. with abl._, before, for, in defense of
    (_proceed_)
  *Rō'mulus*, *-ī*, _m._, Romulus
  *Sabī'nī*, *-ōrum*, _m. plur._, the Sabines
  *vul'nerō*, *vulnerāre*, *vulnerāvī*, *vulnerātus*, wound
    (_vulnerable_)

DE SABINIS

138. Rōmulus Rōmam, clārum oppidum Italiae, aedificāvit. Validī
virī erant Rōmānī et patriam amābant. Saepe prō patriā pugnābant
et saepe Sabīnōs armīs in bellō superābant. Sabīnī bona arma
habēbant et magnō cum studiō pīlīs longīs diū pugnāvērunt. Sed
Rōmānī Sabīnōs fugāvērunt et multōs virōs gladiīs vulnerāvērunt.



LESSON XVIII

THE PERFECT INDICATIVE ACTIVE, SECOND CONJUGATION · THE ABLATIVE
OF ACCOMPANIMENT

139. *Principal Parts of Verbs of the Second Conjugation.* The
principal parts of verbs of the second conjugation are not so
regular as those of the first conjugation. You have already had
some verbs of the second conjugation. Their principal parts are
as follows:

  PRES. IND.       PRES. INF.       PERF. IND.       PERF. PART.
  compleō          complēre         complēvī         complētus
  doceō            docēre           docuī            doctus
  habeō            habēre           habuī            habitus
  maneō            manēre           mānsī            mānsūrus
  moneō            monēre           monuī            monitus
  teneō            tenēre           tenuī            ------
  terreō           terrēte          terruī           territus
  videō            vidēre           vīdī             vīsus

a. Learn the principal parts of these verbs. What is the perfect
stem of each?

141. 1. I have filled, you have seen, we have held. 2. He
frightened, it had, they have filled. 3. She has remained, I have
taught, you (_plur._) have warned.

142. *The Ablative of Accompaniment.*

  *Cum fīliō meō ambulābat*, _he was walking with my son_.

a. Observe that the phrase *cum fīliō* answers the questions
_with whom?_ _in whose company?_ This use of the ablative with
the preposition *cum* is called the _Ablative of Accompaniment_.

143. _*Rule for the Ablative of Accompaniment.* The ablative with
*cum* is used to show accompaniment._

144. VOCABULARY

  *captī'vus*, *-ī*, _m._, captive (_captivate_)
  *cau'sa*, *-ae*, _f._, cause, reason
  *hi'emō*, *hiemāre*, *hiemāvī*, *hiemātūrus*, [1] spend the
    winter
  *lo'cus*, *-ī*, _m._ (_plur. *loca*, n._), place (_location_)
  *perī'culum*, *-ī*, _n._, peril, danger (_peril_)

EXERCISES

145. 1. Puerī carrum nostrum frūmentō complēvērunt. 2. Cum cūrā
puellam aegram certē portāvērunt. 3. Scūta et gladiōs captīvōrum

[1] Future active participle (441, a). This form, if it occurs,
is given in the principal parts where the perfect passive
participle is not in use.



LESSON XIX

THE DEMONSTRATIVE _IS_ · THE PERFECT INDICATIVE OF _SUM_

147. *The Demonstrative _Is_.* The demonstrative *is*, _this_,
_that_, plur. _these_, _those_, is declined as follows:

  SINGULAR
             MASC.              FEM.               NEUT.
  _Nom._     i*s*               e'*a*              i*d*
  _Gen._     e'*ius*            e'*ius*            e'*ius*
  _Dat._     e'*ī*              e'*ī*              e'*ī*
  _Acc._     e'*um*             e'*am*             i*d*
  _Abl._     e'*ō*              e'*ā*              e'*ō*

  PLURAL
             MASC.              FEM.               NEUT.
  _Nom._     i*ī* (e'*ī*)       e'*ae*             e'*a*
  _Gen._     e*ō'rum*           e*ā'rum*           e*ō'rum*
  _Dat._     i*īs* (e'*īs*)     i*īs* (e'*īs*)     i*īs* (e'*īs*)
  _Acc._     e'*ōs*             e'*ās*             e'*a*
  _Abl._     i*īs* (e'*īs*)     i*īs* (e'*īs*)     i*īs* (e'*īs*)

a. *Iī* and *iīs* are pronounced as monosyllables, *ī* and *īs*.

148. *The Uses of _Is_.* There is no word in English like *is*.
Although it is a demonstrative pronoun (II, f) and means _this_
and _that_, it does not point emphatically to what is near, as
does *hic*, or to what is remote, as does *ille* (228). Generally
it refers to somebody or to something that has just been
mentioned. Sometimes it approaches in meaning the English
definite article _the_. It is translated by _this_ or _that_ as
the meaning of the sentence may require.

  1. *Is agricolās convocāvit*, _this_ (or _that_) _man called
    the farmers together_.
  2. *Is servus cum dīligentiā labōrat*, _this_ (or _that_)
    _slave works diligently_.

a. Observe that *is* is used in the first sentence as a pronoun,
and in the second sentence as an adjective (III, e). *Is*, when
an adjective, usually precedes its noun.

b. Decline together *id dōnum*; *is nūntius*; *ea patria*.

149. *The Perfect Indicative of _Sum_.* The perfect indicative of
*sum* is conjugated as follows:

     SINGULAR                          PLURAL
  1. fu'*ī*, _I have been, was_        fu'*imus*, _we have been, were_
  2. fu*is'tī*, _you have been, were_  fu*is'tis*, _you have been, were_
  3. fu'*it*, _he has been, was_       fu*ē'runt*, _they have been, were_

EXERCISES

LESSON XXIII

THE THIRD DECLENSION

171. *The Third Declension.* Nouns of the third declension end
variously in the nominative singular. They are of masculine,
feminine, or neuter gender. Their inflection is illustrated by
the following words:

          *rēx*, m.   *mīles*, m.   *virtūs*, f.   *caput*, n.
          _king_      _soldier_     _valor_        _head_

  _Acc._  rē'g*em*    mī'lit*em*    virtū't*em*    ca'put
  _Abl.   rē'g*e*     mī'lit*e*     virtū't*e*     ca'pit*e*

  _Abl._  rē'g*ibus*  mīli't*ibus*  virtū't*ibus*  capi't*ibus*

  CASE ENDINGS
  SINGULAR                 M. AND F.                      N.
  _Nom._                   *-s* or ----                   ----
  _Gen._                   *-is*                          *-is*

  _Abl._                   *-ibus*                        *-ibus*

a. To decline a noun of the third declension it is necessary to
know the gender, and the spelling of the nominative and the
genitive singular. These things, therefore, must be learned about
every noun of this declension. Often an English derivative will
suggest the spelling of the genitive singular: as, _capital_,
*capitis*; _military_, *mīlitis*.

b. No adequate rule for the gender of nouns of the third
declension can be given. But

  Nouns ending in *-tor* are masculine.
  Nouns ending in *-tās*, *-tūs*, or *-tūdō*, and most nouns
    ending in *-iō* are feminine.
  Nouns ending in *-e*, *-al*, or *-ar* are neuter.

c. Learn the case endings. Then practice the declension of the
nouns above and of those in the vocabulary. Observe that
masculines and feminines are declined alike.

d. Decline together *mīles bonus*, _good soldier_; *virtūs
nostra*, _our valor_; and *caput parvum*, _small head_.

184. *The Ablative of Cause.*

  1. *Lēgātus mīlitem virtūte laudāvit*, _the lieutenant praised
    the soldier for (because of, on account of) his valor.
  2. *Peditēs viā longā sunt dēfessī*, _the foot soldiers are
    tired out with (from, because of) the long march.

a. Observe that the ablatives *virtūte* and *viā* denote _cause_
or _reason_. Observe the various prepositions used in translating
these ablatives: _for_, _with_, _from_, _because of_, _on account
of_. this ablative answers the question _why?_ and is known as
the _Ablative of Cause_.

185. _*Rule for the Ablative of Cause.* The ablative without a
preposition is used to express cause._

186. *Prepositional Phrases expressing Cause.* Cause may also be
expressed by a prepositional phrase consisting of *ob* or
*propter* with the accusative, or of *dē* or *ex* with the
ablative:

  1. *Lēgātus mīlitem ob (propter) virtūtem laudāvit*, _the
    lieutenant praised the soldier on account of his courage_.
  2. *Multīs dē causīs in Italiam properābunt*, _for many reasons
    they will hurry into Italy_.

EXERCISES

187. 1. Multīs dē causīs Rōmānī auxilium nōn mīsērunt. 2.
Lapidibus pīlīsque eōs hominēs vulnerāvērunt. 3. Multa vulnera in

[2] This is a new usage of the genitive case. As used here, the
genitive denotes that of which something consists or is made. It
is called the _Genitive of Material_.



LESSON XXVI

THE THIRD DECLENSION: _I_-STEMS

189. *The Third Declension: _i_-Stems.* Certain nouns of the
third declension have *i*-stems. These include:

  1. Nouns which end in *-is* or *-ēs* in the nominative singular
    and have no more syllables in the genitive singular than in
    the nominative.
  2. Neuters ending in *-e*, *-al*, or *-ar*.
  3. Nouns ending in *-ns* or *-rs*.
  4. Monosyllables ending in *-s* or *-x*, with a consonant
    preceding the *-s* or *-x*.

These nouns show the following peculiarities of declension:

  1. The genitive plural ends in *-ium*.
  2. The accusative plural of masculines and of feminines ends in
    *-īs* or *-ēs*.
  3. The nominative and the accusative plural of neuters end in
    *-ia*.
  4. The ablative singular of neuters and of a few other words
    ends in *-ī*.

The declension of nouns having *i*-stems is illustrated by the
following paradigms:

              *hostis*, m., _enemy_       *mare*, n., _sea_

LESSON XXIX

ADJECTIVES OF THE THIRD DECLENSION

208. *Adjectives of the Third Declension.* Besides the adjectives
of the first and second declensions there are also adjectives of
the third declension. They use the endings of the third
declension of nouns.

a. Some of these adjectives have the same form for the nominative
singular of all three genders: as, *audāx*, _bold_. Others have
the same form for the masculine and feminine nominative singular,
but a different form for the neuter nominative singular: as,
*brevis*, *breve*, _short_. Still others have a different form
for the nominative singular for each gender: as *ācer*, *ācris*,
*ācre*, _keen_, _eager_.

b. Learn the declension of *audāx*, *brevis*, and *ācer* (644).

c. Observe that the adjectives having two or three endings in the
nominative singular have only *-ī* in the ablative singular.
Adjectives of one ending more often have *-ī* than *-e* in the
ablative. Compare the endings of these adjectives with the
endings of nouns having *i*-stems (189). What differences are
there?

d. Decline *proelium ācre*, _keen battle_; *corpus breve*, _short
body_; *hostis audāx*, _bold enemy_; *vir ācer*, _bold man_.

  *labor*, *labōris*, _m._, toil, hardship (_laborious_)
  *omnis*, *-e*, all, every, the whole (_omnipresent_)
  *potestās*, *potestātis*, _f._, power

NOTE. In the vocabularies the genitive singular will be given of
adjectives of one ending; but in the case of adjectives of two or
of three endings all the forms of the nominative singular will be
given.

LESSON XXXII

THE PLUPERFECT AND FUTURE PERFECT INDICATIVE ACTIVE OF ALL
CONJUGATIONS

223. *The Formation of the Pluperfect and Future Perfect Tenses.*
The pluperfect (XXXIII, b) and the future perfect (XXXIII, b)
indicative active of *amō* are inflected as follows:

  PLUPERFECT

  1. amā'v*eram*,                          amāv*erā'mus*,
     _I had loved_                         _we had loved_
  2. amā'v*erās*,                          amāv*erā'tis*,
     _you had loved_                       _you had loved_
  3. amā'v*erat*,                          amā'v*erant*,
     _he had loved_                        _they had loved_

  FUTURE PERFECT

  1. amā'v*erō*,                           amāv*e'rimus*,
     _I shall have loved_                  _we shall have loved_
  2. amā'v*eris*,                          amāv*e'ritis*,
     _you will have loved_                 _you will have loved_
  3. amā'v*erit*,                          amā'v*erint*,
     _he will have loved_                  _they will have loved_

a. Observe that the pluperfect is formed by adding the imperfect
of *sum* (108) to the perfect stem; and the future perfect by
adding the future of *sum* to the perfect stem. One form,
however, is not spelled as it is in the inflection of *sum*.
Which form?

b. The tense sign of the pluperfect is *-erā-*; of the future
perfect, *-eri-*.

c. What are the perfect stems of *moneō*, *regō*, *capiō*,
*audiō*, and *sum*? Inflect the pluperfect and future perfect
tenses of these verbs, and of the verbs in 203.

d. What auxiliary verbs (IV, f) are to be used in translating
these tenses? What English tense is the same as the pluperfect?

e. The perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect use the perfect
stem, and so belong to the perfect system of the verb. Make
synopses (671) in this system of the model verbs.

224. VOCABULARY

  *cīvitās*, *cīvitātis*, _f._, state, clan
  *Labiēnus*, *-ī*, _m._, Labienus, a Roman officer
  *populus*, *-ī*, _m._, people (_population_)

LESSON XXXIII

THE DEMONSTRATIVES _HIC_ AND _ILLE_ · PLACE FROM WHICH AND TO
WHICH, IN NAMES OF TOWNS

227. *The Demonstratives _Hic_ and _Ille_.* Review the declension
of *is* (654), and learn the declension of *hic* and *ille*
(654).

a. Decline *hic prīnceps*, *haec cīvitās*, *hoc tēlum*, *ille
Gallus*, *illa nox*, and *illud tempus*.

228. *The Distinction between _Is_, _Hic_, and _Ille_.* *Is* is
used indifferently for _this_ or _that_ without emphasis (148).
*Hic* means _this_, and *ille* _that_, with a certain emphasis.
*Hic* is applied to what is _near_ the speaker in place, time, or
thought. *Ille* is applied to what is _not near_ the speaker in
place, time, or thought. *Hic* and *ille*, like *is*, are used
both as demonstrative adjectives and as demonstrative pronouns:
as, *hoc dōnum meum, illud tuum est*, _this gift is mine, that is
yours_. Demonstratives, when used as adjectives, regularly
precede their nouns.

229. *Place from Which and to Which, in Names of Towns.* You have
already learned that _place from which_ is expressed by the
ablative with *ā (ab)*, *dē*, *ē (ex)* (178); and that _place
to which_ is expressed by the accusative with *ad* or *in* (180).
If, however, the _place from which_ or _to which_ is the name of
a town, the prepositions are omitted: as, *Rōmā vēnit*, _he came
from Rome_; *Rōmam vēnit*, _he came to Rome_. *Domus*, _home_,
also omits the preposition: *domum vēnit*, _he came home
(homeward)_.

230. _*Complete Rules for Place from Which and to Which.*_

a. _Place from which is usually expressed by the ablative with *ā
(ab)*, *dē*, *ē (ex)*; but with the names of towns, and with
*domus*, the preposition is omitted._

b. _Place to which is usually expressed by the accusative with
*ad* or *in*; but with the names of towns, and with *domus*, the
preposition is omitted._

231. VOCABULARY

  *Athēnae*, *-ārum*, _f. plur._, Athens
  *Capua*, *-ae*, _f._, Capua
  *Carthāgō*, *-inis*, _f._, Carthage

  *Delphī*, *-ōrum*, _m. plur._, Delphi
  *domum*, _acc._, home, homeward
  *domō*, _abl._, from home
  *frāter*, *frātris*, _m._, brother (_fraternal_)
  *hic*, *haec*, *hoc*, _dem. pron. or adj._, this
  *ille*, *illa*, *illud*, _dem. pron. or adj._, that

EXERCISES

232. 1. Dux illōs equitēs peditēsque Capuam mīsit. 2. Tandem ex
Italiā Carthāginem propter commūne perīculum properāvit. 3. Hī
mīlitēs Athēnīs vēnerant et in Galliā pugnābant. 4. Secundā

LESSON XXXIV

READING LESSON

VICTORIA CAESARIS

234. In Galliā multae et fortēs cīvitātēs erant. Prīncipēs hārum
cīvitātum potestātem imperiaque Rōmānōrum timuērunt. Multōs
mīlitēs igitur convocāverant et inter montīs et collīs Rōmānōs
exspectābant.

Prīmō annō bellī populus Rōmānus Caesarem contrā Gallōs mīsit. Is
dux, cum Labiēnō et peditibus et paucīs equitibus, ex Italiā
aestāte properāvit et sine perīculō in fīnīs Gallōrum vēnit. Hīs
in locīs explōrātōrēs Caesaris hostēs repperērunt.

Prīmā lūce mīlitēs Rōmānī Gallōs oppugnāvērunt. Ācre erat
proelium. Gallī lapidibus et tēlīs gravibus locum dēfendēbant.
Nostrī pīla iaciēbant et gladiīs hostīs sustinēbant. Tandem Gallī
dēfessī ob inopiam tēlōrum et vulnera trāns flūmen fūgērunt.

Decem annīs Caesar multa bella in Galliā gessit et multōs
captīvōs Rōmam mīsit.

DE CAESARE ET BRITANNIS

236. Quod Britannī ad Gallōs auxilium saepe mīserant, Caesar in
īnsulam Britanniam nāvigāvit. Territī (_although frightened_)
magnō numerō nāvium et virōrum, Britannī fortēs magnā cum virtūte
prō patriā pugnāvērunt. Tandem tamen ab lītore fūgērunt. Post hoc
proelium Rōmānī agrōs hostium vāstāvērunt et oppida occupāvērunt
et multam praedam cēpērunt. Cassivellaunus, prīnceps Britannōrum,
lēgātōs ad Caesarem mīsit. Caesar obsidēs postulāvit. Cum hīs
obsidibus et captīvīs multīs ex Britanniā in Galliam vēnit.
Propter hanc victōriam magna erat potestās Rōmānōrum in
Britanniā.

[Illustration: IN BRITANNIAM CAESAR NAVIGAT]



LESSON XXXV

THE PRESENT, IMPERFECT, AND FUTURE INDICATIVE PASSIVE OF THE
FIRST AND SECOND CONJUGATIONS · THE ABLATIVE OF AGENT

237. *The Passive Voice.* In the active voice the subject of the
verb is _acting_; in the passive voice it is _acted on_ (XXVIII):
as

  _The general praises the soldier_ (active).
  _The soldier is praised by the general_ (passive).

238. *The Present Indicative Passive of the First Conjugation.*
The present indicative passive of *amō* is inflected as follows:

  SINGULAR                                          PERS. ENDINGS
  1. a'mo*r*, _I am loved (I am being loved)        *-r*
  2. amā'*ris*, _you are loved_                     *-ris*
  3. amā'*tur*, _he, she, it is loved_              *-tur*

  PLURAL                                            PERS. ENDINGS
  1. amā'*mur*, _we are loved_                      *-mur*
  2. amā'*minī*, _you are loved_                    *-minī*
  3. ama*n'tur*, _they are loved_                   *-ntur*

a. Observe that these passive forms differ from the active only
in the personal endings. The endings are added to the present
stem *amā-* exactly as they were in the active voice.

239. *The Imperfect and Future Indicative Passive of the First
Conjugation.* Compare the imperfect and the future active and
passive of *amō* (658). Observe that the passive endings are
added to the tense stems *amābā-* and *amābi-*, exactly as in the
active voice, except in the second person singular of the future,
where *-bi-* is changed to *-be-*. Learn these tenses of *moneō*
(659).

EXERCISES

240. 1. Amat, amātur. 2. Amābat, amābātur. 3. Amābit, amābitur.
4. Amant, amantur. 5. Amābant, amābantur. 6. Amābuntne?
amābunturne? 7. Amāmus, amāmur. 8. Moneō, moneor. 9. Monēbam,
monēbar. 10. Monēbō, monēbor. 11. Monēbitis, monēbiminī. 12.
Monētis, monēminī.

241. 1. You praise, you are praised. 2. They were praising, they
were being praised. 3. You will praise, you will be praised. 4. I
teach, I am taught. 5. We teach, we are taught. 6. We shall
teach, we shall be taught. 7. They teach, they are taught.

242. *The Ablative of Agent.*

  1. *Labiēnus mīlitem laudat*, _Labienus praises the soldier_.
  2. *Mīles ab Labiēnō laudātur*, _the soldier is being praised
    by Labienus_.

a. Observe the changes made in turning the active sentence into
the passive: (1) the object in the active becomes the subject in
the passive; (2) the subject of the active is expressed in the
passive by the ablative with *ab*. This ablative is known as the
_Ablative of Agent_.

b. The _agent_ is the person doing something. The ablative of
_agent_ should not be confused with the ablative of _means_
(122), which has no preposition: as *mīles lapide vulnerātur*,
_the soldier is wounded by a stone_; *mīles ā Gallō vulnerātur*,
_the soldier is wounded by a Gaul_.

243. _*Rule for the Ablative of Agent.* The personal agent with a
passive verb is expressed by the ablative with *ā* or *ab*._

EXERCISES

244. 1. Hic puer ā frātre meō laudābātur. 2. Haec praeda Rōmam ā
Caesare portābitur. 3. Ā quō nōn amātur potestās? 4. Fābulae
multae dē Britanniā ab iīs nūniīs nārrābuntur. 5. Oppidum ab

2. My brothers were praised by that boy. 3. Aid is being awaited
by the enemy. 4. A few cohorts were seen by the chief. 5. Rome
was loved by all the Romans.



LESSON XXXVI

THE RELATIVE _QUI_

246. *The Relative _Quī_.* The relative *quī*, _who_, _which_,
_that_, is declined as follows:

  SINGULAR                             PLURAL
  _Nom._   quī     quae    quod        quī      quae     quae
  _Gen._   cuius   cuius   cuius       quōrum   quārum   quōrum
  _Dat._   cui     cui     cui         quibus   quibus   quibus
  _Acc._   quem    quam    quod        quōs     quās     quae
  _Abl._   quō     quā     quō         quibus   quibus   quibus

a. Compare the declension of the relative *quī* with that of the
interrogative *quī* (154).

247. *Agreement of the Relative with its Antecedent.*

  1. *Puellae quās laudāvimus bonae erant*, _the girls whom we
    praised were good_.
  2. *Praemium quod ille homō portat laudātur*, _the reward which
    that man is bringing is praised_.
  3. *Homō cuius gladium habeō est nauta*, _the man whose sword I
    have is a sailor_.

a. Observe that the relative (II, d) in each sentence refers to a
certain word. This word is called its _antecedent_ (II, b).
Observe that the relative has the same gender and number as its
antecedent, but that its case is different. Thus, in sentences 1
and 2 it is accusative because it is the object of *laudāvimus*
or of *portat*; in sentence 3 it is genitive because it indicates
the possessor of *gladium*.

b. A relative clause modifies its antecedent as an adjective
modifies its noun.

248. _*Rule for the Agreement of the Relative.* A relative
pronoun agrees with its antecedent in gender and number but its
case depends on the way it is used in its own clause._

249. VOCABULARY

  *cōnsilium*, *cōnsi'lī*, _n._, advice, plan (_counsel_)
  *frūstrā*, _adv._, in vain (_frustrate_)
  *legiō*, *legiōnis*, _f._, legion (_legionary_)
  *māter*, *mātris*, _f._, mother (_maternal_)

LESSON XXXVIII

THE PERSONAL AND REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS

263. *The Personal Pronouns.* The personal pronouns (II, c) are
*ego*, _I_; *tū*, _you_; *is*, _he_; *ea*, _she_; *id*, _it_.

In reality there is no pronoun of the third person in Latin. The
demonstrative *is* (148, 228) is so often used as a personal
pronoun that it may be classed as the pronoun of the third
person. Sometimes the demonstratives *hic* and *ille* are
similarly used. Learn the declension of the personal pronouns
(652).

264. *The Personal Pronouns as Subjects of Verbs.* The personal
pronouns are expressed as subjects only for emphasis, especially
the emphasis of contrast: as, *ego tē laudō, tū mē nōn laudās*,
_*I* praise you, *you* do not praise me_.

265. *The Reflexive Pronouns.* A reflexive pronoun refers to the
subject of its clause (II, h). Learn the declension of the
reflexive pronouns (653).

266. *The Use of the Reflexive Pronouns.* The use of the
reflexive pronouns is illustrated by the following sentences:

  1. *Tū tē amās*, _you love yourself_.
  2. *Omnēs hominēs sē amant*, _all men love themselves_.

a. Observe that *tē* and *sē* refer to the subjects of their
sentences.

b. Remember that *is*, _he_; *ea*, _she_; and *id*, _it_, are
used as personal pronouns, but not as reflexive pronouns; and
that *suī* is always a reflexive pronoun, and not a personal
pronoun.

267. *Relative Clauses referring to Personal Pronouns.*

  *Tū, quī venīs, es amīcus meus*, _you, who are coming, are my
    friend_.

a. Observe that the verb of the relative clause is in the same
person as the antecedent.

268. VOCABULARY

  *ego*, _pers. pron._, I (_egotistic_)
  *interficiō*, *interficere*, *interfēcī*, *interfectus*, kill

Perseum interficere volēbat [2]; nam propter imperia deōrum
puerum timēbat. Cēpit igitur eum adhūc īnfantem, et cum mātre in
arcā posuit. Tum in mare arcam iēcit. Danaē, Perseī māter, maximē
timēbat, tempestās enim magna mare perturbābat. Perseus autem in
sinū (_in the arms_) mātris dormiēbat.

[1] Never the first word in the sentence or clause.

[2] *interficere volēbat*, _wished to kill_. The infinitive used
in this way is called a complementary infinitive (394).



LESSON XL

THE POSSESSIVE ADJECTIVES · THE ABLATIVE OF SEPARATION

278. *The Possessive Adjectives.* The possessive adjectives are
as follows:

  meus, -a, -um, _my_
  noster, -tra, -trum, _our_
  tuus, -a, -um, _your_ (sing.)
  vester, -tra, -trum, _your_ (plur.)
  suus, -a, -um, _his_, _her_, _its_, _their (own)_, used
    reflexively

a. To show possession the possessive adjectives are used instead
of the genitives *meī*, *tuī*, *nostrum*, *vestrum*, and *suī*.
They may also be used as possessive pronouns: as, *mea*, _mine_;
*nostrī*, _our men_.

279. *The Distinction between _Suus_ and the Possessive Genitive
of _Is_.*

  1. *Mīles scūtum eius habet*, _the soldier has his shield_
    (i.e. somebody else's shield).
  2. *Mīles suum scūtum habet*, _the soldier has his own shield_.

a. *Eius* (sentence 1) does not refer to the subject; *suum*
(sentence 2) does refer to the subject. *Suus* is always
reflexive, but the genitives of *is*, *ea*, *id* are never
reflexive.

280. *When Possessive Adjectives are used in Latin.* When the
meaning is clear, a possessive adjective is omitted unless
emphatic: as,

  1. *Caesar mīlitēs in castra redūxit*, _Cæsar led his soldiers
    back into camp_.
  2. *Caesar suōs mīlitēs in castra redūxit*, _Cæsar led his
    (own) soldiers back into camp_ (but the others he left
    outside).

281. *The Ablative of Separation.*

  1. *Hic homō cibō caret*, _this man lacks (is separated from)
    food_.
  2. *Germānī Rōmānōs ā fīnibus suīs prohibēbant*, _the Germans
    were keeping the Romans away from their lands_.

a. Observe that the ablative here is used to denote that from
which there is freedom, removal, or separation, or that which is
lacking. The ablative so used answers the questions _from what?_
_of what?_ and is called the _Ablative of Separation_. It is of
the same nature as the ablative of _place whence_.

282. _*Rule for the Ablative of Separation.* Words signifying
*privation*, *removal*, or *separation* are followed by the
ablative without a preposition, or with the prepositions *ā
(ab)*, *dē*, *ē (ex)*._

283. VOCABULARY

  *posteā*, _adv._, afterwards
  *suus*, *-a*, *-um*, his (own), her (own), its (own), their
    (own)
  *careō*, *carēre*, *caruī*, *caritūrus*, lack, want (_caret_)
  *dēsistō*, *dēsistere*, *dēstitī*, *dēstitūrus*, leave off,
    cease (_desist_)
  *interclūdō*, *interclūdere*, *interclūsī*, *interclūsus*, cut
    off, shut off (_conclude_)
  *prīvō*, *prīvāre*, *prīvāvī*, *prīvātus*, keep from, deprive
    of (_privation_)
  *prohibeō*, *prohibēre*, *prohibuī*, *prohibitus*, keep away
    (from), restrain (_prohibit_)

EXERCISES

284. 1. Caesar autem suōs mīlitēs trāns flūmen mīsit. 2. Caesar
eius frātrem in castrīs reperiet. 3. Ill vir aeger aquā
prīvābātur. 4. Posteā ea cīvitās cibō et frūmentō carēbat. 5. Ab
aedificiīs et pecūniā huius populī mīlitēs diū prohibuit. 6. Ob
inopiam armōrum proeliō Germānī dēstitērunt. 7. Nostrī, quī in
castra Germānōrum properāverant, eōs tēlīs prīvāvērunt. 8. Flūmen
nostrōs viā interclūdēbat. 9. Apud flūmen nāvigia ab hostibus eō
tempore aedificābantur.

LESSON XLI

THE PERFECT, PLUPERFECT, AND FUTURE PERFECT INDICATIVE PASSIVE OF
ALL CONJUGATIONS

286. *The Perfect, Pluperfect, and Future Perfect of All
Conjugations.*

a. Review the principal parts of *amō*, and notice especially the
perfect passive participle. Examine the formation of the perfect
indicative passive (658). Observe that it is formed by using the
present tense of *sum* with the perfect passive participle
*amātus*. Those tenses which are formed with the help of the
perfect passive participle belong to the participial system of
the verb (671).

b. Examine the pluperfect and the future perfect indicative
passive. Observe that they are formed by using the imperfect and
the future of *sum* with the perfect passive participle.

c. The perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect indicative passive
of all verbs are formed in the same way.

d. The participle *amātus* is declined like *bonus*; and so in
the nominative singular and plural it is changed to agree with
the subject of the verb in number and gender. These changes are
made because a participle is an adjective in its nature. Observe
these changes as illustrated in 287.

e. Recall the principal parts of *moneō*, *regō*, *capiō*, and
*audiō*, and inflect the perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect
passive of these verbs and of those in 252.

warned. 2. The buildings have been taken, had been taken, will
have been taken. 3. The territories had been ruled by the
Germans. 4. The cities will have been defended. 5. And so we
(_fem._) shall have been heard.

  *ibi*, _adv._, there
  *impedīmentum*, *-ī*, _n._, hindrance; _plur._, baggage
    (_impediment_)
  *imperātor*, *imperātōris*, _m._, general, commander
    (_emperor_)

Paucī Germānī ibi tēlīs nostrōrum interfectī sunt. 3. Tua verba ā
mē audīta erunt. 4. Eō tempore imperātor ab impedīmentīs
carrīsque interclūsus erat. 5. Bellum, quod ā Caesare gestum est,

erat, sine morā Rōmam portāta est. 8. In conciliō suīs Caesar
dīxit, "Cōnsilia mea ab hostibus nōn impedīta sunt."

IUPPITER PERSEUM SERVAT (CONTINUED FROM 277)

291. Iuppiter tamen haec omnia vīdit, et fīlium suum servāre
cōnstituit (_determined to save_). Tranquillum igitur fēcit mare,
et arcam ad īnsulam Serīphum dūxit. Huius īnsulae Polydectēs tum
rēx erat. Postquam [1] arca ad lītus ducta est, Danaē in harēnā
dormiēbat. Post breve tempus ā virō reperta est, et ad rēgem
adducta est. Ille mātrem et puerum bene recēpit, et eīs sēdem
tūtam in fīnibus suīs praebuit.

[1] *Postquam* introduces a subordinate clause of time (XX, e).



LESSON XLII

LESSON XLIII

THE COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES

296. *Degrees of Comparison.* Latin adjectives have three degrees
of comparison, the positive, the comparative, and the
superlative. But in Latin, as in English, there are certain
adjectives which are not compared.

  POSITIVE
  *lātus*, *-a*, *-um*, _wide_ (BASE *lāt-*)
  *brevis*, *-e*, _short_ (BASE *brev-*)
  *audāx*, _bold_ (BASE *audāc-*)

  COMPARATIVE
  *lātior*, *lātius*, _wider_
  *brevior*, *brevius*, _shorter_
  *audācior*, *audācius*, _bolder_

  SUPERLATIVE
  *lātissimus*, *-a*, *-um*, _widest_
  *brevissimus*, *-a*, *-um*, _shortest_
  *audācissimus*, *-a*, *-um*, _boldest_

a. Observe that the comparative is formed by adding to the base
of the positive the endings *-ior* for the masculine and the
feminine, and *-ius* for the neuter; the superlatvie by adding to
the base of the positive *-issimus*, *-issima*, *-issimum*.

b. Compare *cārus*, *grātus*, *longus*, *fortis*, and *gravis*.

c. The comparative may be translated _wider_, _more wide_,
_rather wide_, _too wide_; the superlative _widest_, _most wide_,
_very wide_.

297. *The Declension of the Comparative.* The comparative is
declined as follows:

         SINGULAR                  PLURAL
         M. AND F.    N.           M. AND F.          N.
  _Nom._ lā'tior      lā'tius      lātiō'rēs          lātiō'ra
  _Gen._ lātiō'ris    lātiō'ris    lātiō'rum          lātiō'rum

LESSON XLIV

THE COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES ENDING IN _-ER_ OR _-LIS_ · THE
PARTITIVE GENITIVE

306. *The Comparison of Adjectives in _-er_.* Adjectives ending
in *-er* are compared as follows:

  miser, misera, miserum,_wretched_
  miserior, miserius
  miserrimus, -a, -um

  ācer, ācris, ācre, _keen_
  ācrior, ācrius
  ācerrimus, -a, -um

a. Observe that the comparative of these adjectives is regular;
but the superlative is formed by adding *-rimus*, *-rima*,
*-rimum* to the nominative masculine of the positive. Compare
similarly *aeger*.

307. *The Comparison of Adjectives in _-lis_.* The comparative of
the following adjectives ending in *-lis* is regular; but the
superlative is formed by adding *-limus*, *-lima*, *-limum* to
the base of the positive. Learn their meaning and comparison.

  facilis, -e, _easy_
  facilior, -ius
  facillimus, -a, -um

  difficilis, -e, _hard_
  difficilior, -ius
  difficillimus, -a, -um

  similis, -e, _like_
  similior, -ius
  simillimus, -a, -um

  dissimilis, -e, _unlike_
  dissimilior, -ius
  dissimillimus, -a, -um

Most other adjectives in *-lis* are compared regularly: as,
*nōbilis*, *nōbilior*, *nōbilissimus*.

308. *The Partitive Genitive.*

  1. *Ille amīcus cōpiam pecūniae habet*, _that friend has plenty
    of money_.
  2. *Multī mīlitum vulnerātī sunt*, _many of the soldiers were
    wounded_.

a. Observe that each genitive denotes a whole, and the word on
which it depends denotes a part of that whole. Such a genitive,
of which a part is taken, is called a _Partitive Genitive_.

309. _*Rule for the Partitive Genitive.* Words denoting a part
may have with them a genitive of the whole from which the part is
taken._

a. Numerals and a few other words have the ablative with *ē (ex)*
or *dē* instead of the partitive genitive: as, *decem ex
mīlitibus*, _ten of the soldiers_.

Minerva eī viam dēmōnstrāvērunt. Prīmum ad Graeās, sorōrēs
Medūsae, pervēnit. Hārum auxiliō tālāria et galeam magicam
accēpit. Mercurius et Minerva eī falcem et speculum dedērunt.
Tum, postquem tālāria pedibus induit, [5] in āera [6] ascendit.
Diū per āera volābat; tandem tamen ad eum locum vēnit ubi Medūsa
cum reliquīs Gorgonibus incolēbat. Gorgones mōnstra erant quārum

LESSON XLVI

IRREGULAR COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES · THE ABLATIVE OF DEGREE OF
DIFFERENCE

317. *Adjectives Compared Irregularly.* Both the comparative and
the superlative of several common adjectives are irregular.
Commit to memory the following:

  bonus, -a, -um, _good_
  melior, melius, _better_
  optimus, -a, -um, _best_

  magnus, -a, -um, _large_
  maior, maius, _larger_
  maximus, -a, -um, _largest_

  malus, -a, -um, _bad_
  peior, peius, _worse_
  pessimus, -a, -um, _worst_

  multus, -a, -um, _much_
  ------, plūs, _more_
  plūrimus, -a, -um, _most_

  parvus, -a, -um, _little_, _small_
  minor, minus, _less_, _smaller_
  minimus, -a, -um, _least_, _smallest_

318. *The Declension of _Plūs_.* In the singular *plūs*, _more_,
is used only as a neuter noun. Learn the declension of *plūs*
(648).

319. *Other Adjectives Compared Irregularly.* There are other
adjectives that are compared irregularly, some of which have no
positive, but form their comparative and superlative from
prepositions or adverbs, and others of which have two forms in
the superlative. See 649. These should be learned as they occur
in the vocabularies.

320. *The Ablative of Degree of Difference.*

  1. *Pater pede altior est quam fīlius*, _the father is a foot
    taller than his son_.
  2. *Pāx multō grātior erit quam bellum*, _peace will be much
    more welcome than war_.

a. Observe that the ablatives *pede* and *multō* answer the
question _(by) how much?_ They denote the _degree of difference_
between the objects compared. This usage is called the _Ablative
of Degree of Difference_.

321. _*Rule for the Ablative of Degree of Difference.* The degree
of difference is expressed by the ablative._

322. VOCABULARY

  *centum*, _adj._, _indecl._, a hundred (_century_)
  *īnferus*, *-a*, *-um*, low, below (649) (_inferior_)
  *interdum*, _adv._, sometimes

ā centum mīlitibus dēfendēbantur. 7. Tua operae pars est maior
quam mea. 8. Interdum amīcī nōbīs cōnsilium malum dant. 9. Summum
montem [1] videō. 10. Italiae pars īnferior propter multās
Graecōrum urbēs Magna Graecia appellābātur; superior pars
Italiae, quod ibi Gallī incolēbant, Gallia Cisalpīna vel (_or_)
Gallia Citerior appellābātur.

LESSON XLVII

THE FORMATION AND THE COMPARISON OF ADVERBS

325. *The Formation of Adverbs.* Many adverbs are formed from
adjectives. From adjectives of the first and second declensions
adverbs are formed by the addition of *-ē* to the base of the
positive; from adjectives of the third declension they may be
formed by the addition of *-iter* to the base: as, *cārē*,
_dearly_, from *cārus*, _dear_; *miserē*, _wretchedly_, from
*miser*, _wretched_; *ācriter*, _eagerly_, from *ācer*, _eager_;
but most adjectives of one ending add *-ter* to the base: as,
*audācter*, from *audāx*.

a. Form adverbs from *grātus*, *lātus*, *longus*, *līber*,
*aeger*, *brevis*, *fortis*, *gravis*.

326. *The Irregular Formation of Adverbs.* Some adverbs are the
accusative or ablative singular neuter of the adjective: as,
*multum*, _much_, from *multus*; *multō*, _much_, from *multus*;
*facile*, _easily_, from *facilis*.

327. *The Comparison of Adverbs.*

  POSITIVE                COMPARATIVE                SUPERLATIVE
  cārē                    cārius                     cārissimē
  miserē                  miserius                   miserrimē
  ācriter                 ācrius                     ācerrimē
  facile                  facilius                   facillimē
  bene                    melius                     optimē
  male                    peius                      pessimē
  multum                  plūs                       plūriumum

a. Observe that the comparative of the adverb is the same as the
neuter singular comparative of the adjective; and that the
superlative, with one exception, is formed from the superlative
of the adjective by changing final *-us* to *-ē*.

328. VOCABULARY

  *amplus*, *-a*, *-um*, large, spacious (_ample_)
  *arbor*, *arboris*, _f._, tree (_arboreal_)
  *dīligenter*, _adv._, diligently (_diligent_)
  *diū* (*diūtius*, *diūtissimē*), _adv._, long
  *hinc*, _adv._, hence, from here, from this place
  *līberī*, *-ōrum*, _m. plur._, children (_liberty_)
  *multitūdō*, *-inis*, _f._, great number (_multitude_)
  *subitō*, _adv._, suddenly
  *praemittō*, *praemittere*, *praemīsī*, *praemissus*, send
    ahead (_premise_)
  *relinquō*, *relinquere*, *relīquī*, *relictus*, leave behind,
    leave (_relinquish_)

EXERCISES

329. 1. Patrēs et mātrēs suōs līberōs maximē amant. 2. Eīs
cōnsilia optima dant et prō eīs dīligentissimē labōrant. 3. Tum

[Illustration: GALLIC SWORD]



LESSON XLVIII

THE FIFTH DECLENSION · THE ACCUSATIVE OF EXTENT

331. *The Fifth Declension.* Nouns of the fifth declension end in
*-ēs*. They are feminine, with the exception of *diēs*, _day_,
which is usually masculine. They are inflected as follows:

         SING.    PLUR.      SING.   PLUR.     CASE ENDINGS
  _Nom._ di'*ēs*  di'*ēs*    r*ēs*   r*ēs*     *-ēs*         *-ēs*
  _Gen._ di*ē'ī*  di*ē'rum*  r*e'ī*  r*ē'rum*  *-ēī*, *-ĕī*  *-ērum*
  _Dat._ di*ē'ī*  di*ē'bus*  r*e'ī*  r*ē'bus*  *-ēī*, *-ĕī*  *-ēbus*
  _Acc._ di'*em*  di'*ēs*    r*em*   r*ēs*     *-em*         *-ēs*
  _Abl._ di'*ē*   di*ē'bus*  r*ē*    r*ē'bus*  *-ē*          *-ēbus*

a. The vowel *e* of the case endings is regularly long. It is
shortened, however, in the ending *-eī* after a consonant, and in
the ending *-em*: as, *rĕī* and *rem*.

b. Only *diēs* and *rēs* are complete in the plural. A few other
nouns have the nominative and the accusative plural. Decline
*aciēs*, *fidēs*, and *spēs*.

332. *The Accusative of Extent.*

  1. *Decem annōs urbs oppugnābātur*, _the city was besieged for
    ten years_.
  2. *Turris est centum pedēs alta*, _the tower is a hundred feet
    high_.

a. The accusative *decem annōs* denotes _extent of time_; the
accusative *centum pedēs* denotes _extent_ of _space_. Such
accusatives answer the questions _how long?_ _how far?_ in time
or in space. This usage is called the _Accusative of Extent_.

333. _*Rule for the Accusative of Extent.* Extent of time or of
space is expressed by the accusative._

334. VOCABULARY

  *aciēs*, *-ēī*, _f._, line of battle
  *altus*, *-a*, *-um*, high, deep (_alto_)
  *diēs*, *-ēī*, _m._, day (_diary_)
  *fidēs*, *-eī*, _f._, trust, confidence (_fidelity_)
  *plānitiēs*, *-ēī*, _f._, plain (_plane_)
  *posterus*, *-a*, *-um*, next (649)
  *rēs*, *-eī*, _f._, thing, event, fact (_reality_)
  *spēs*, *-eī*, _f._, hope
  *īnstruō*, *īnstruere*, *īnstrūxī*, *īnstrūctus*, draw up,
    marshal (_instruct_)
  *castra pōnere*, to pitch camp

EXERCISES

335. 1. Caesar castra summō in monte prīmum posuit. 2. Castra
summō in monte ā Caesare posita sunt. 3. Hinc hostēs magnā in
plānitiē vīsī sunt. 4. Inter hunc montem et illam plānitiem erat
flūmen, quod centum pedēs lātum et quīnque pedēs altum erat. 5.
Caesar autem aciem īnstrūxit et impetum hostium exspectābat. 6.
Eius equitēs maiōrem partem diēī in cornibus manēbant. 7. Sed
hostēs impetum nōn fēcērunt, quod parvam victōriae spem
habuērunt. 8. Tum adulēscentēs frūmentō plūrīs diēs caruērunt. 9.
Collēs post castra nostra multis pedibus altiōrēs sunt.

PERSEUS MEDUSAM INTERFICIT (CONTINUED FROM 316)

339. Rēs difficillima erat caput Gorgonis abscīdere, [6] eius
enim cōnspectū hominēs in saxum vertēbantur. Propter hanc causam
Minerva speculum Perseō dederat. Ille igitur tergum vertit, et in
speculum īnspiciēbat; hōc modō ad locum prōcessit ubi Medūsa
dormiēbat. Tum falce suā caput eius ūnō ictū abscīdit. Reliquae
Gorgones statim ē somnō excitātae sunt, et, ubi [7] rem vīdērunt,
perturbātae sunt. Arma rapuērunt, et Perseum interficere
volēbant. [8] Ille autem dum fugit, [9] galeam magicam induit;

[1] *laetus*, _gladly_.

[2] *apud*, _with_.

[3] *sitās*, _situated_.

[4] *valē*, _farewell_. This form is the imperative singular of
*valeō*. See XXXI, a.

[5] *mī amīce*, _my friend_. These words are in the vocative case

LESSON L

THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD · THE PRESENT SUBJUNCTIVE PURPOSE CLAUSES
WITH _UT_ AND _NE_

340. *The Subjunctive Mood.* The Latin subjunctive is used in
both independent and dependent clauses, but the kinds of
dependent clauses in which the subjunctive is used are far more
numerous than the independent. In this book only some uses in
dependent clauses will be studied.

341. *The Tenses of the Subjunctive.* There are four tenses of
the subjunctive: present, imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect. No
meanings are given for the tenses of the subjunctive, because the
translation varies with the use of the mood (cf. 343, 357, 372).

342. *The Present Subjunctive.* The present subjunctive of the
several conjugations and of *sum* is inflected as follows:

     ACTIVE                          PASSIVE
  1. a'm*em*        am*ē'mus*        a'm*er*          am*ē'mur*
  2. a'm*ēs*        am*ē'tis*        am*ē'ris*        am*ē'minī*
  3. a'm*et*        a'm*ent*         am*ē'tur*        am*en'tur*

  1. mone*am*       mone*āmus*       mone*ar*         mone*āmur*
  2. mone*ās*       mone*ātis*       mone*āris*       mone*āminī*
  3. mone*at*       mone*ant*        mone*ātur*       mone*antur*

  1. reg*am*        reg*āmus*        reg*ar*          reg*āmur*
  2. reg*ās*        reg*ātis*        reg*āris*        reg*āminī*
  3. reg*at*        reg*ant*         reg*ātur*        reg*antur*

  1. capi*am*       capi*āmus*       capi*ar*         capi*āmur*
  2. capi*ās*       capi*ātis*       capi*āris*       capi*āminī*
  3. capi*at*       capi*ant*        capi*ātur*       capi*antur*

  1. audi*am*       audi*āmus*       audi*ar*         audi*āmur*
  2. audi*ās*       audi*ātis*       audi*āris*       audi*āminī*
  3. audi*at*       audi*ant*        audi*ātur*       audi*antur*

  1. sim            sīmus            ------           ------
  2. sīs            sītis            ------           ------
  3. sit            sint             ------           ------

a. Observe that the mood sign of the present subjunctive of the
regular verbs is *-ē-* in the first conjugation, and *-ā-* in the
others.

b. Learn the present subjunctive of the verbs above. Then inflect
the present subjunctive active and passive of *dūcō*, *mittō*,
*recipiō*, *reperiō*, and *videō*. The present subjunctive
belongs in the present system (671).

343. *Purpose Clauses.*

  1. *Cīvēs sē armant ut pugnent*, _the citizens arm themselves
    that they may fight_ (or, _in order that they may fight_, _in
    order to fight_, _for the purpose of fighting_, _to fight_).
  2. *Cīvēs sē armant nē superentur*,  _the citizens arm
    themselves that they may not be overcome_ (or, _in order not
    to be overcome_, _so that they may not be overcome_, _lest
    they be overcome_).

a. Observe that the dependent clauses express the _purpose_ of
the action of the principal clause, *ut*, _that_, introducing the
affirmative clause, and *nē*, _that not_, the negative clause.

b. Observe the various ways of translating *ut* and *nē* and the
subjunctive in these clauses. In English, purpose is most often
expressed by the infinitive. In the best Latin prose, however,
the purpose of an action is not expressed by the infinitive.

344. _*Rule for Purpose Clauses.* The subjunctive is used with
*ut* or *nē* in a dependent clause to express the purpose of the
action stated in the independent clause._

EXERCISES

345. 1. Nūntium mittit ut cīvēs moneat. 2. Adulēscēns mittitur ut
cīvēs moneantur. 3. Legiō mittitur nē oppidum ab hostibus
capiātur. 4. Legiōnēs fortiter pugnant ut oppidum capiant. 5.
Puer venit ut fābulam audiat. 6. Puerī veniunt ut verba tua
audiant. 7. Eōs mittimus ut prōvinciam regant. 8. Eōs mittimus ut
prōvincia ab eīs regātur. 9. In Galliam properātis ut bellum
gerātis. 10. Centum mīlitēs praemittimus ut castra mūniant.

346. 1. He is sent to fight. 2. We sent them to find the way. 3.
You are sent that the enemy may not make an attack on the city.
4. The soldiers are led out of the camp that a line of battle may
be drawn up. 5. I am coming to see you and your mother. 6. He
fights to defend himself.



LESSON LI

THE IMPERFECT SUBJUNCTIVE · SEQUENCE OF TENSES

347. *The Imperfect Subjunctive.* The imperfect subjunctive may
be formed by adding the personal endings to the present
infinitive active; but the final *-e* of the infinitive is
lengthened in certain forms.

a. Learn the imperfect subjunctive of the model verbs and of
*sum* (658-663). The imperfect subjunctive belongs in the present
system (671).

348. *Sequence of Tenses.* Examine the following English
sentences:

  1. He _comes (is coming)_ that he _may_ fight.
  2. He _will come_ that he _may_ fight.
  3. He _came_ that he _might_ fight.

a. Observe that in sentences 1 and 2 the verbs in the independent
clauses are present and future, and that in sentence 3 the verb
in the independent clause is past. Observe the change from _may_
(present) to _might_ (past) when a past tense takes the place of
a present or a future in the verb of the independent clause. This
following of one tense by another of the same kind is called
_Sequence of Tenses_.

349. *Primary and Secondary Tenses.* Those tenses of the
indicative which refer to present or to future time (present,
future, and future perfect) are called _Primary Tenses_. Those
tenses of the indicative which refer to past time (imperfect,
perfect, and pluperfect) are called _Secondary Tenses_.

350. _*Rule for Primary Sequence.* When the verb of the
independent clause of a sentence is in a primary tense, a verb in
the dependent clause is in the present tense if its action is
incomplete, but in the perfect tense if its action is completed._

351. _*Rule for Secondary Sequence.* When the verb of the
independent clause of a sentence is in a secondary tense, a verb
in the dependent clause is in the imperfect tense if its action
is incomplete, but in the pluperfect if its action is completed._

a. Observe that all the verbs in the independent clauses in 345
are in the present tense, and that all the verbs in the dependent
clauses are in the present subjunctive. If the verbs in the
independent clauses should be changed to the future or the future
perfect tense, what would be the tense of the subjunctive in the
dependent clauses?

352. _*Rule for the Tense of the Subjunctive in Purpose Clauses.*
Since a purpose clause expresses an incomplete action, its verb
will be in the present subjunctive if the verb in the independent
clause is in a primary tense, and in the imperfect subjunctive if
the verb of the independent clause is in a secondary tense._

EXERCISES

353. 1. Veniunt ut pācem petant. 2. Veniēbant ut pācem peterent.
3. Venient ut pācem petant. 4. Vēnerant ut pācem peterent. 5.
Fortiter pugnābant nē ā Gallīs vincerentur. 6. Trāns flūmen
properāverant ut oppidum oppugnārent. 7. Legiōnēs mittentur ut
hostēs commeātibus interclūdantur. 8. Ut portum dēfenderent
nostrī praemissī sunt. 9. Cōnsul audācissimē dīcet ut populum
Rōmānum incitet.

354. 1. They labor that they may be praised. 2. They were
laboring that they might be praised. 3. They will labor that they
may be praised. 4. They had labored that they might be praised.
5. They threw weapons from the higher places in order to hinder
the Romans. 6. He had called together the chiefs to hear the new
plan. 7. They will desist from battle that they may not be
killed.

LESSON LII

SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES OF PURPOSE · RESULT CLAUSES

355. *Substantive Clauses of Purpose.* A substantive clause is a
clause used like a noun (XX, d); it may be the subject or the
object of a verb. Purpose clauses with *ut* and *nē* are often
used in Latin as the objects of certain verbs: as,

  *Petit ut obsidēs dent*, _he asks them to give hostages (that
    they give hostages)_.

a. Observe that the clause *ut obsidēs dent* is the object of
*petit*. This is, therefore, a noun clause. The purpose clauses
in the preceding lessons were adverbial in nature (XX, c).

356. _*Rule for Substantive Clauses of Purpose.* Verbs meaning
*ask*, *command*, *persuade*, and *urge* may have for their
object a clause of purpose with its verb in the subjunctive._

a. In English an infinitive is generally used in the object
clause.

357. *Result Clauses.*

  1. *Iter tam longum est ut puer sit dēfessus*, _the journey is
    so long that the boy is tired out_.
  2. *Puer tam malus fuit ut ā patre nōn laudārētur*, _the boy
    was so bad that he was not praised by his father_.

a. Observe that the dependent clauses beginning with *ut* express
the result of the statements in the independent clauses, and that
the subjunctive is translated by an English indicative.

b. Observe that the sequence is the same as in purpose clauses,
but that the negative clause contains *ut nōn* (not *nē*).

358. _*Rule for Result Clauses.* The subjunctive is used with
*ut* or *ut nōn* in a dependent clause to express the result of
the action stated in the independent clause. The sequence of
tenses is generally the same as in purpose clauses._

359. VOCABULARY

  *ita*, _adv._, so, in such a way
  *tam*, _adv._, so
  *tantus*, *-a*, *-um*, so great
  *agō*, *agere*, *ēgī*, *āctus*, act, do (_agent_)
  *circumveniō*, *circumvenīre*, *circumvēnī*, *circumventus*,
    surround (_circumvent_)
  *imperō*, *imperāre*, *imperāvī*, *imperātus*, command, order
    (_imperative_)

EXERCISES

360. 1. Puer ita ēgit ut ab omnibus amārētur. 2. Urbs vāstāta est
nē ab hostibus caperētur. 3. Eum monēmus nē mīles sit. 4.

inopia cibī ut plūrimī aegrī sint. 6. Urbs tam fortiter dēfēnsa
est ut decem diēbus nōn caperētur. 7. Hostēs in silvās fūgērunt
nē ā nostrīs circumvenīrentur. 8. Caesar prīmum postulāvit ut
nostrīs auxilium darētur.

361. 1. They were so few that they fled. 2. They were so brave
that they did not flee. 3. I advise him to be more bold. 4. The
lieutenant led the soldiers out of the camp in order to draw up a
line of battle. 5. He demands that they pitch camp in this place.

LESSON LIV

THE PERFECT AND THE PLUPERFECT SUBJUNCTIVE · INDIRECT QUESTIONS

371. *The Perfect and the Pluperfect Subjunctive.* The perfect
and the pluperfect subjunctive active are formed on the perfect
stem (671):

  *amāv* *-erim*, *-erīs*, *-erit*,     *-erīmus*, *-erītis*, *-erint*
  *amāv* *-isstem*, *-issēs* *-isset*,  *-issēmus*, *-issētis*, *-issent*

The perfect and the pluperfect subjunctive passive belong to the
participial system (671).

a. Learn these tenses of the model verbs and of *sum* (658-663).
Inflect the entire subjunctive of *agō*, *pōnō*, *dō*, and
*videō*.

372. *Indirect Questions.* An indirect question is a subordinate
clause which contains the substance of a direct question: as,

  1. *Ubi sunt?* _where are they?_
  2. *Audit ubi sint*, _he hears where they are_.

a. Observe that the dependent clause in 2 begins with an
interrogative word (*ubi*) and contains the substance of the
direct question in 1. Observe that the subjunctive mood is used,
and that the clause is substantive in nature. Every subordinate
clause introduced by an interrogative word is an indirect
question.

b. An indirect question, with its verb in the subjunctive, may be
used as the subject or the object of another verb. Indirect
questions usually follow the general rule for the sequence of
tenses: as,

  1. *Audit*, _he hears_
  2. *Audiet*, _he will hear_
  3. *Audīverit*, _he will have heard_
  . . .
  *ubi sint*, _where they are_
  *ubi fuerint*, _where they were_ or _where they have been_

  1. *Audiēbat*, _he was hearing_
  2. *Audīvit*, _he heard_
  3. *Audīverat*, _he had heard_
  . . .
  *ubi essent*, _where they were_
  *ubi fuissent*, _where they had been_

373. _*Rule for Indirect Questions.* The verb of an indirect
question is in the subjunctive. If the verb of the independent
clause is in a primary tense, the verb of the indirect question
is put in the present subjunctive for an incomplete action, but
in the perfect for a completed action. If the verb of the
independent clause is in a secondary tense, the verb of the
indirect question is put in the imperfect subjunctive for an
incomplete action, but in the pluperfect for a completed action._

374. VOCABULARY

  *num*, _adv._, whether
  *quot*, _adv._, how many (_quotient_)
  *unde*, _adv._, whence
  *rogō*, *rogāre*, *rogāvī*, *rogātus*, ask (_arrogant_)
  *sciō*, *scīre*, *scīvī*, *scītus*, know (_science_)

LESSON LV

NUMERAL ADJECTIVES · THE OBJECTIVE GENITIVE

377. *Numeral Adjectives.* For the definition of numeral
adjectives see III, c. A list of Latin cardinal and ordinal
numerals is given in 651.

378. *The Declension of Numeral Adjectives.* The cardinals
*ūnus*, _one_, *duo*, _two_, *trēs*, _three_, are declined; so,
too, are the words for the _hundreds_, as, *ducentī*, _two
hundred_, *trecentī*, _three hundred_, and (in the plural)
*mīlle*, _thousand_. The other cardinals are not declined. The
ordinals are declined as adjectives of the first and second
declensions.

a. Learn the declension of *ūnus*, *duo*, *trēs*, and *mīlle*
(646).

379. *The Use of _Mīlle_.* The singular of *mīlle* is
indeclinable, and is used either as an adjective or as a neuter
noun: *mīlle _(adj.)_ hominēs*, _a thousand men_, or *mīlle
_(noun)_ hominum*. The plural is used only as a noun. When used
as a noun it takes the partitive genitive: *mīlle hominum*, _a
thousand (of) men_; *quattuor mīlia hominum*, _four thousand(s
of) men_.

380. *The Objective Genitive.*

  *Spēs praedae hominēs incitat*, _hope of booty impels the men_.

a. Observe that the genitive *praedae* expresses the thing hoped
for, the object of the hope. This usage of the genitive case is
called the _Objective Genitive_. The difference between the
possessive and the objective genitive is illustrated by *timor
canis*, _fear of the dog_, which may mean the dog's fear
(possessive) or fear felt for the dog (objective).

381. _*Rule for the Objective Genitive.* Some nouns of action and
feeling may have with them a genitive to express the object of
the action or feeling implied in the nouns._

celeritāte ad lītus mōnstrum properāvit, iamque ad locum

LESSON LVII

THE INFINITIVE AS SUBJECT AND AS COMPLEMENT

392. *The Infinitive.* The infinitives of *amō* are as follows:

  ACTIVE
  _Pres._ amāre, _to love_
  _Perf._ amāvisse, _to have loved_
  _Fut._ amātūrus esse, _to be about to love_, _to be going to
    love_

  PASSIVE
  amārī, _to be loved_
  amātus esse, _to have been loved_
  (amātum īrī, _to be about to be loved_)

a. Observe that the present infinitive passive is formed from the
active by changing final *-e* to *-ī*. But in the third
conjugation final *-ere* is changed to *-ī*.

b. The perfect infinitive active is formed by adding *-isse* to
the perfect stem.

c. The perfect infinitive passive is formed by using the perfect
participle with *esse*, the present infinitive of *sum*.

d. The future infinitive active is formed by using the future
active participle, *amātūrus*, with *esse*. The future active
participle is made by changing final *-tus* or *-sus* of the
perfect passive participle to *-tūrus* or *-sūrus*. Form the
future active participles of *pōnō*, *īnstruō*, *videō*, *mittō*,
and *gerō*.

e. Learn the infinitives and meanings of the model verbs and
*sum* (658-663). The future infinitive passive may be omitted. It
is rare.

393. *The Infinitive as Subject.* Since the infinitive is a noun
it may be used as the subject or the object of a verb. Since it
is a _verbal_ noun, it may have a subject or an object of its own
and be modified by adverbs, adverb phrases, or adverb clauses.

  1. *Laudārī est grātum*, _to be praised is pleasing_.
  2. *Iter per fīnēs hostium facere erit difficile*, _to march
    through the territory of the enemy will be difficult_.

a. Observe that *laudārī* is the subject of *est*, and *iter per
fīnēs hostium facere* of *erit*, while *iter* is the object of
*facere*. Of what gender are *grātum* and *difficile*? What,
then, is the gender of the infinitive?

394. *The Complementary Infinitive.*

  1. *Vincere potest*, _he is able to conquer_.
  2. *Bonī esse dēbēmus*, _we ought to be good_.

a. Observe that *vincere* and *esse* complete the meaning of
*potest* and *dēbēmus*. An infinitive so used is called a
_Complementary Infinitive_, and it is common in Latin, as in
English, with verbs meaning _be able_, _decide_, _ought_, _wish_,
_begin_, etc. You have already met this usage of the infinitive
in several of the selections for reading.

b. The predicate adjective used with a complementary infinitive
agrees in gender, number, and case with the subject of the main
verb.

395. VOCABULARY

  *coepī*, *coepisse* (_lacks the present system_), began
  *dēbeō*, *dēbēre*, *dēbuī*, *dēbitus*, ought, be obliged to
    (_debit_)
  *decimus*, *-a*, *-um*, tenth (_decimate_)
  *potest*, is able, can
  *possunt*, are able, can (_possible_)

EXERCISES

396. 1. Venīre, dare, discēdere potest. 2. Impedīrī, pōnī,
conlocārī possunt. 3. Praemia recipere saepe est grātum. 4.
Caesar reliquōs agrōs et oppida illīus cīvitātis vāstāre coepit.
5. Tua verba audīre est difficillimum. 6. Germānī Rōmānōs
commeātibus interclūdere nōn possunt. 7. Statim multitūdō pācem
petere coepit. 8. Sē dēfendere dēbent. 9. Quis tōtīus exercitūs
tam fortis fuit ut impetum hostium sustinēret? 10. Hieme diēs
quīnque hōrīs breviōrēs quam aestāte sunt.

of the tenth legion. 4. To carry on a war is not often best. 5.

others to flee.



LESSON LVIII

THE INFINITIVE AS OBJECT · THE ACCUSATIVE AS SUBJECT OF THE
INFINITIVE · INDIRECT STATEMENTS

398. *The Infinitive as Object.*

  *Mē venīre iussit*, _he ordered me to come_.

a. Observe that in the English sentence the object of _ordered_
is _me to come_; and that _me_ is in the objective case and
subject of the infinitive _to come_. The Latin sentence is like
the English; *mē* is in the accusative case. Verbs meaning
_order_ and _wish_ are the commonest verbs having an infinitive
as their object; but *imperō*, _order_, takes a substantive
clause of purpose (356). The objective infinitive is also used in
indirect statements (400-402).

399. _*Rule for the Accusative as Subject of the Infinitive.* The
subject of the infinitive is in the accusative._

400. *Indirect Statements.* A direct statement gives the exact
words used by a speaker or writer: as, _He says_ (or _said_)
_"Soldiers are coming." In an indirect statement the words of a
speaker or writer are made to depend on a verb of _saying_,
_thinking_, etc., and in English may or may not be the same as
they were in the original statement or thought: as, _He says that
soldiers are coming_, _he said that soldiers were coming_.
Observe the same sentences in Latin:

  1. *Mīlitēs veniunt*, _soldiers are coming_.
  2. *Dīcit mīlitēs venīre*, _he says that soldiers are coming_.
  3. *Dīxit mīlitēs venīre*, _he said that soldiers were coming_.

a. Observe that in turning a direct statement into an indirect
statement in Latin the nominative is changed to the accusative
(399) and the indicative to the infinitive.

401. _*Rule for Indirect Statements.* Indirect statements, with
verb in the infinitive and subject in the accusative, are found
in dependence on verbs of *saying*, *thinking*, *knowing*,
*perceiving*, and the like._

402. *The Use of the Tenses of the Infinitive in Indirect
Statements.* The _present_ infinitive is used when the action of
the indirect statement is going on at the _same_ time as the
action indicated by the verb of _saying_, _thinking_, etc.: as,

  1. *Dīcit mīlitēs venīre*, _he says that soldiers are coming_.
  2. *Dīxit mīlitēs venīre*, _he said that soldiers were coming_.
  3. *Dīcet mīlitēs venīre*, _he will say that soldiers are
    coming_.

The _perfect_ infinitive is used when the action of the indirect
statement occurred _before_ that of the verb of _saying_,
_thinking_, etc.: as,

  1. *Dīcit mīlitēs vēnisse*, _he says that soldiers came_ (or
    _have come_).
  2. *Dīxit mīlitēs vēnisse*, _he said that soldiers came_ (or
    _had come_).
  3. *Dīcet mīlitēs vēnisse*, _he will say that soldiers came_
    (or _have come_).

The _future_ infinitive is used when the action of the indirect
statement occurs _after_ that of the verb of _saying_,
_thinking_, etc.: as,

  1. *Dīcit mīlitēs ventūrōs esse*, _he says that soldiers will
    come_.
  2. *Dīxit mīlitēs ventūrōs esse*, _he said that soldiers would
    come_.
  3. *Dīcet mīlitēs ventūrōs esse*, _he will say that soldiers
    will come_.

403. VOCABULARY

  *cognōscō*, *cognōscere*, *cognōvī*, *cognitus*, learn, know,
    understand (_recognize_)
  *cupiō*, *cupere*, *cupīvī (cupiī)*, *cupītus*, desire, wish
    (_cupidity_)
  *iubeō*, *iubēre*, *iussī*, *iussus*, bid, order, command
    (_jussive_)
  *respondeō*, *respondēre*, *respondī*, *respōnsus*, answer,
    reply (_respond_)

EXERCISES

404. 1. Caesar per duōs explōrātōrēs cognōvit hostēs sex mīlia
passuum iter fēcisse. 2. Sociī respondent sē sine morā auxilium
ad Caesarem missūrōs esse. 3. Imperātor dīxit sē suīs praemia
ampla datūrum esse. 4. Omnēs cupiunt esse līberī. 5. Omnēs
cupiunt Italiam esse līberam. 6. Omnēs vident oppidum fortiter
dēfendī. 7. Statim tertiam aciem īnstruī Caesar iussit. 8.

PERSEUS CEPHEO ANDROMEDAM REDDIT (CONTINUED FROM 391)

408. At Perseus ubi haec vīdit, gladium suum ēdūxit, et postquam
tālāria induit, per āera volāvit. Tum dēsuper in mōnstrum impetum
subitō fēcit, et gladiō suō collum eius graviter vulnerāvit.
Mōnstrum ubi sēnsit vulnus, fremitum horribilem ēdidit et sine
morā tōtum corpus in aquam mersit. Perseus dum circum lītus
volat, reditum eius exspectābat. Mare autem interim undique
sanguine īnficitur. Post breve tempus bēlua rūrsus caput
ostendit; mox tamen ā Perseō ictū graviōre vulnerāta est. Tum
iterum sē in undās mersit, neque posteā vīsa est.

Perseus postquam ad lītus dēscendit, prīmum tālāria exuit; tum ad
rūpem vēnit ubi Andromeda vīncta erat. Ea autem omnem spem
salūtis dēposuerat, et ubi Perseus pervēnit, terrōre paene
exanimāta erat. Ille vincula statim solvit, et puellam patrī
reddidit. Cēpheus ob hanc rem maximō gaudiō adfectus est. Itaque
Andromedam Perseō in mātrimōnium dedit. Paucōs annōs Perseus cum
uxōre in eā regiōne habitābat, et in magnō honōre erat apud omnīs
Aethiopēs.

LESSON LX

THE DEMONSTRATIVES _IDEM_, _IPSE_, _ISTE_ · THE IRREGULAR VERB
_POSSUM_

409. *The Demonstratives _Īdem_, _Ipse_, and _Iste_.* Review the
declension of *is*, *hic*, and *ille* (654), and learn the
declension of *īdem*, _same_, *ipse*, _-self_, and *iste*, _this
of yours_, _that of yours_ (654).

a. Observe that *īdem* is declined like *is* with *-dem* added,
except that in the accusative singular and the genitive plural
*m* is changed to *n*, and in the nominative and accusative
singular *is* is changed to *ī*, *id* to *i*.

b. Decline together *īdem diēs*, *rēs ipsa*, and *istud
cōnsilium*.

410. *The Distinction between _Īdem_, _Ipse_, and _Iste_.

a. *Īdem* and *iste* may be used both as demonstrative adjectives
and as demonstrative pronouns.

b. *Iste* is used of that which has some relation to the second
person, and is translated _this of yours_, _that of yours_,
_your_: as, *istam dīligentiam laudō*, _I praise that diligence
of yours (your diligence)_.

c. *Ipse* means _-self (himself, herself, itself, themselves)_.
It is an intensive word, used to emphasize a noun or pronoun,
expressed or understood, with which it agrees as an adjective:
as, *amīcus ipse ad mē vēnit*, _my friend himself came to me_. It
must be distinguished from *sē*, _-self_, which is reflexive, not
emphatic (266). Sometimes *ipse* may be translated _even_ or
_very_: as, *in flūmine ipsō pugnant*, _they are fighting in the
very river_.

411. *The Irregular Verb _Possum_.* The irregular verb *possum*,
_I can_, is a compound of *potis*, _able_, and *sum*, _I am_;
*pot-sum* changed to *possum*. Wherever, in the inflection of
this verb, *t* comes before *s*, it is changed to *s*, and
wherever it comes before *f*, *f* is dropped. Learn the principal
parts and the complete inflection (664).

412. VOCABULARY

  *difficultās*, *difficultātis*, _f._, difficulty
  *īdem*, *eadem*, *idem*, same (_identity_)
  *item . . . quī*, same . . . as

  *rūrsus*, _adv._, again
  *nūntiō*, *nūntiāre*, *nūntiāvi*, *nūntiātus*, report, announce
    (_annunciator_)

pronouns will be used in this book:

  aliquis, aliqua, aliquid, aliquod, _some_, _some one_, _any_,
    _any one_
  quīdam, quaedam, quiddam, quoddam, _a certain one_, _a certain_
  quisquam, ------, quidquam (no plural), _any one (at all)_
  quisque, quaeque, quidque, quodque, _each_, _each one_,
    _every_, _every one_

a. Learn the meanings and the declensions of these pronouns
(657).

b. The meanings of the neuters (_something_, _anything_, etc.)
are easily inferred.

c. Observe how *aliqua*, which is both the feminine nominative
singular and the neuter nominative and accusative plural of
*aliquis*, differs from the corresponding forms of *quis*.

d. Observe that *quīdam* (*quī* + *dam*) is declined like *quī*,
except that in the accusative singular and genitive plural *m* is
changed to *n*; also that the neuter has *quiddam* and *quoddam*
in the nominative and accusative singular.

e. In the neuter of all indefinites the *quid* forms are used as
pronouns, and the *quod* forms as adjectives.

THE NATIONS OF GAUL

423. Gallia est omnis dīvīsa (_divided_) in partīs trēs, quārum
ūnam incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquītānī, tertiam eī quī Gallī
appellantur. Hōrum omnium fortissimī sunt Belgae, quod prōvinciae
Rōmānae propinquī nōn sunt neque mercātōrēs ad eōs saepe
perveniunt; proximīque sunt Germānīs quī trāns Rhēnum incolunt,
quibuscum bellum gerunt. Quī dē causā (_for this reason_, 186)
Helvētiī quoque fortiōrēs quam reliquī Gallī sunt. Cotīdiānīs
ferē proeliīs cum Germānīs contendunt, cum (_when_) aut
(_either_) suis fīnibus eōs prohibent aut (_or_) ipsī in eōrum
fīnibus bellum gerunt. Ea pars quam Gallī obtinent īnitium capit
ā flūmine Rhodanō; continētur Garumnā (_Garonne_) flūmine,
ōceanō, fīnibus Belgārum.



LESSON LXII

THE DATIVE WITH COMPOUNDS · THE DATIVES OF PURPOSE AND REFERENCE

424. *The Dative with Compounds.*

  1. *Quis equitibus praefuit?* _who commanded the horsemen?_
  2. *Hic legiōnī lēgātum praefēcit*, _he put a lietenant in
    charge of this legion_.

a. Observe that *praefuit*, which is a compound of *sum*, is
intransitive. It does not admit a direct object, but does admit
the indirect object *equitibus*. There are a number of Latin
verbs which in their simple form take neither a direct nor an
indirect object; when these verbs are compounded with a
preposition, they have a meaning which may take an indirect
object. Some compound verbs take both a direct and an indirect
object: as, *praefēcit* in sentence 2.

425. _*Rule for the Dative with Compounds.* Some verbs compounded
with *ad*, *ante*, *con*, *dē*, *in*, *inter*, *ob*, *post*,
*prae*, *prō*, *sub*, and *super*, take a dative of the indirect
object. Transitive compounds may take both an accusative and a
dative._

426. *The Datives of Purpose and Reference.*

  1. *Mīlitēs ibi erant praesidiō*, _soldiers were there as (for)
    a defense_.
  2. *Mīlitēs auxiliō eīs mittuntur*, _soldiers are sent as (for)
    a help to them_.

a. Observe that the datives *praesidiō* and *auxiliō* are used to
express the purpose for which something serves. This usage is
called the _Dative of Purpose_. Often the dative of purpose is
accompanied by another dative, called the _Dative of Reference_,
denoting the person or thing served: as, *eīs* in sentence 2.
This combination is known as the _Double Dative_.

427. _*Rule for the Dative of Purpose.* The dative is used to
denote the purpose for which a thing serves._

428. _*Rule for the Dative of Reference.* The dative is used to
denote the person (or, rarely, the thing) affected by the action
or situation expressed by the verb._

429. VOCABULARY

  *mūnītiō*, *mūnītiōnis*, _f._, fortification, defense
    (_ammunition_)
  *praesidium*, *praesi'dī*, _n._, defense, protection, guard

    wanting, fail
  *occurrō*, *occurrere*, *occurrī*, *occursūrus*, run toward,
    meet (_occur_)
  *praeficiō*, *praeficere*, *praefēcī*, *praefectus*, place in
    command of (_prefect_)

    of, command
  *supersum*, *superesse*, *superfuī*, *superfutūrus*, be left
    over, survive

LESSON LXIII

THE DATIVE WITH SPECIAL INTRANSITIVE VERBS · THE IRREGULAR VERBS
_VOLO_, _NOLO_, _MALO_

432. *The Dative with Special Intransitive Verbs.*

  1. *Legiōnī imperat*, _he commands a legion_.
  2. *Amīcō meō persuādet*, _he persuades my friend_.

a. Observe that *legiōnī* and *amīcō* are in the dative case,
while the English equivalents are in the objective case. It is
obvious, therefore, that the Latin verbs *imperō* and *persuādeō*
are intransitive, and that they admit an indirect object.

433. _*Rule for the Dative with Special Intransitive Verbs.* Most
verbs meaning *believe*, *favor*, *help*, *please*, *trust*, and
their opposites, also *command*, *obey*, *pardon*, *persuade*,
*resist*, *serve*, *spare*, and the like, take a dative of the
indirect object._

a. Such verbs used in this book are *crēdō*, _believe_; *faveō*,
_favor_; *imperō*, _command_; *noceō*, _harm_; *persuādeō*,
_persuade_; *placeō*, _please_; *resistō*, _resist_; and
*studeō*, _desire_, _be eager for_.

b. Observe that *imperō* has an indirect object, while *iubeō*
takes a direct object.

434. *The Irregular Verbs _Volō_, _Nōlō_, and _Mālō_.* Learn the
principal parts and the conjugation of *volō*, _wish_, *nōlō*
(*nē* + *volō*), _be unwilling_, and *mālō* (*magis volō*), _be
more willing_, _prefer_, in the indicative, subjunctive, and

BELLING THE CAT

438. Quīdam mūrēs aliquandō concilium habēbant, nam fēlem maximē
timēbant. Cōnsilia quae prōposita sunt omnibus nōn placēbant.
Tandem ūnus ex mūribus ita dīxit: "Tintinnābulum caudae fēlis
adnectere dēbēmus. Sīc enim sonitū eius monēbimur et fugere
poterimus. Quis vestrum hoc facere vult?" Sed nūllī ex sociīs
persuādēre potuit ut tintinnābulum fēlī adnecteret, et ipse
nōluit. Ea fābula docet plūrimōs in suādendō [1] esse audācēs sed
in ipsō perīculō timidōs.

NASICA AND ENNIUS

439. Nāsīca aliquandō ad poētam [2] Ennium vēnit et dē eō
quaesīvit. Ancilla respondit Ennium domī [3] nōn esse. Nāsīca

Paucīs post diēbus [4] Ennius ad Nāsīcam vēnit. Eī exclāmat
Nāsīca sē domī nōn esse. Tum Ennius dīxit, "Quid? Ego nōn
cognōscō vōcem tuam?" Hīc [5] Nāsīca: "Homō est impudēns. Ego
ancillae tuae crēdidī; tū mihi ipsī nōn crēdis?"

ORGETORIX AND THE HELVETIANS

440. Apud Helvētiōs longē nōbilissimus erat Orgetorīx. Is rēgnī

Helvētiī continentur: ūnā ex parte (_on one side_) flūmine Rhēnō,
lātissimō atque altissimō, quī agrum Helvētiōrum ā Germānīs
dīvidit; alterā ex parte monte Iūrā altissimō, quī est inter
Sēquanōs et Helvētiōs; tertiā (ex parte) lacū Lemannō et flūmine
Rhodanō, quī prōvinciam nostram ab Helvētiīs dīvidit. Propter
multitūdinem hominum et glōriam bellī angustōs sē fīnēs habēre
putābant, quī in longitūdinem mīlia passuum CCXL (decenta
quadrāgintā), in lātitūdinem CLXXX (centum octōgintā) patēbant.

[1] *suādendō*, _offering advice_.

[2] *ad poētam*, _to the house of the poet_.

[3] *domī*, _at home_.

[4] *paucīs post diēbus*, _a few days later_.

[5] *hīc*, adv., _hereupon_.



LESSON LXV

PARTICIPLES

441. *Participles.* Learn the participles of the model verbs
(658-662), and their meanings.

a. Observe that the present active and the future passive
participles are formed from the present stem by the addition of
*-ns* and *-ndus*, with certain changes in quantity; and the
future active and the perfect passive from the participial stem
by the addition of *-ūrus*, and *-us*. But observe that in verbs
of the fourth conjugation and of the third conjugation ending in
*-iō* the present active participle has *-iēns* and the future
passive participle has *-iendus*. Form the participles of *gerō*,
*videō*, *iaciō*, *vāstō*, and *mūniō*.

442. *The Declension of Participles.* Participles in *-ns* are
declined like *amāns* (645). The ablative singular ending is
*-e*; but the ending is *-ī* when the word is used as an
adjective. The other participles are declined like *bonus* (643).
Decline the participles of *gerō*.

443. *The Agreement of Participles.* Since participles are verbal
adjectives (XXXIV), they agree with nouns or pronouns in gender,
number, and case.

444. *The Tenses of Participles.* The present active participle
is used of an action going on at the same time as the action of
the main verb: as, *tē labōrantem videō*, _I see you working_;
*tē labōrantem vīdī*, _I saw you working_.

The perfect passive participle is used of an action that is
completed at the time of the action of the main verb: as, *mīles
vulnerātus domum vēnit*, _the soldier, having been wounded, came
home_.

The future active and passive participles are used of actions
which are to occur after the time of the action of the main verb.
In this book the future active participle is used only in the
formation of the future active infinitive (392, d). The uses of
the future passive participle will be explained later (471-473).

445. *The Translation of Participles.*

  1. *Tē in urbe manentem vīdī*, _I saw you when you were staying
    in the city_.
  2. *Urbs diū oppugnāta nōn capta est*, _the city, though
    besieged for a long time, was not taken_.
  3. *Caesar eā rē commōtus in Galliam properāvit*, _Cæsar,
    because he was alarmed by this circumstance, hastened into
    Gaul_.
  4. *Dux victus sē recipiet*, _the general, if defeated, will
    retreat_.
  5. *Dōna missa recēpit*, _he received the gifts which had been
    sent_.
  6. *Caesar prīncipem captum Rōmam mīsit*, _Cæsar captured a
    chieftain and sent him to Rome_.

a. Observe that in the first five sentences the participle is
translated by clauses of _time_, _concession_, _cause_, and
_condition_, and by a _relative clause_. In 6 the participle is
translated by a coördinate verb. Note the words which introduce
the different clauses. When you meet a participle, consider which
of these six ways best brings out the thought of the sentence and
translate accordingly. Do not translate a participle literally.

446. VOCABULARY

  *hīberna*, *-ōrum*, _n. plur._, winter quarters (_hibernate_)
  *commoveō*, *commovēre*, *commōvī*, *commōtus*, disturb, move,
    arouse (_commotion_)
  *moveō*, *movēre*, *mōvī*, *mōtus*, move (_motion_)
  *redūcō*, *redūcere*, *redūxī*, *reductus*, lead back
    (_reduce_)

EXERCISES

relinquēbat. 8. Multitūdō servōrum territa ex urbe fugiēbat. 9.
Posterō diē castra mōvērunt.

[Illustration: ROMAN STYLES OF HAIRDRESSING]



LESSON LXVII

THE ABLATIVE ABSOLUTE

452. *The Ablative Absolute.*

  1. *Cōnsul, catrīs mūnītīs, Rōmam vēnit*, _with the camp
    fortified, the consul came to Rome_.
  2. *Caesare dūcente, semper vincimus*, _with Cæsar leading, we
    always conquer_.
  3. *Caesare duce, vincēmus*, _with Cæsar as leader, we shall
    conquer_.

a. Observe that the ablatives in these sentences are so loosely
connected with the rest of the sentence that they are
gramatically independent. Because of its loose connection with
the sentence this usage of the ablative is known as the _Ablative
Absolute_ (*ab* + *solvō*).

453. *How to translate the Ablative Absolute.* The ablative
absolute is usually translated, not as above, but by a clause:
thus,

  1. _When (because, although, if) the camp had been fortified,
    the consul came to Rome._
  2. _When (because, although, if) Cæsar is leading, we always
    conquer._
  3. _When (because, although, if) Cæsr is leader, we shall
    conquer._

The method of translation in any particular sentence must be
determined by asking which kind of clause best expresses the
thought of the sentence as a whole.

454. *The Formation of the Ablative Absolute.* The ablative
absolute may be formed by a noun or pronoun with a participle (as
in 452, 1 and 2); or by a noun or pronoun with another noun or an
adjective (as in 452, 3). The present active and perfect passive
participles are used in this construction. Since the verb *sum*
has no present participle, a participle is not expressed when the
ablative absolute is formed as it is in 452, 3: *Caesare duce*,
_Cæsar (being) leader_.

a. An ablative absolute containing a perfect passive participle
expresses an action that occurred before the action expressed by
the main verb of the sentence; one containing a present
participle expresses an action occurring at the same time as that
of the main verb.

b. The Latin perfect participle is not found in the active voice.
Accordingly such a sentence as _Cæsar, having defeated the Gauls,
returned to Rome_ has to be recast into the form _Cæsar, the
Gauls having been defeated, returned to Rome_, *Caesar Gallīs
victīs, Rōmam rediit*.

c. The noun of the ablative absolute is always a different person
or thing from the subject or object of the sentence.

455. _*Rule for the Ablative Absolute.* The ablative of a noun or
pronoun, with a participle, a noun, or an adjective in agreement,
is used to express time, cause, concession, condition, or other
relations._

456. VOCABULARY

  *dēditiō*, *dēditiōnis*, _f._, surrender
  *ēruptiō*, *ēruptiōnis*, _f._, sally, sortie (_eruption_)
  *medius*, *-a*, *-um*, middle of (_medium_)
  *rīpa*, *-ae*, _f._, bank (_riparian_)

EXERCISES

457. 1. Hostibus victīs, per mediam prōvinciam iter facere
cōnstituit. 2. Caesare cōnsule, cum Gallīs longum erat bellum. 3.
Oppidō quōdam expugnātō, castra in rīpīs ipsīs huius flūminis
posuērunt. 4. Helvētiī omnium rērum inopiā adductī lēgātōs dē
dēditiōne ad Caesarm mīsērunt. Hīs rēbus repertīs, omnēs bellō
studēbant. 6. Hoc oppidum, paucīs dēfendentibus, Rōmānī capere
nōn potuērunt. 7. Captīvīs in dēditiōnem acceptīs, dux subsidiō
castrīs trēs cohortēs relīquit. 8. Hī captīvī eīdem fortissimē
pugnantēs captī erant. 9. Quis praefuit equitibus quī imperātōrī
auxiliō missī sunt? 10. Urbe mūnītā, cīvēs nōn iam terrēbantur.

458. 1. When he had heard these words, he was much disturbed. 2.
When the city had been taken, the soldiers set the prisoners
free. 3. The enemy resisted our men all day. 4. If Labienus is

LESSON LXVIII

THE GERUND · THE IRREGULAR VERB _EO_

459. *The Gerund.* The gerund (XXXII, c) is a verbal noun used in
the genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative singular. It is
formed by adding *-ndī*, *-ndō*, *-ndum*, *-ndō* to the present
stem, with certain changes in quantity and spelling. Learn the
gerunds of the model verbs (658-662).

460. *What the Gerund is.* The gerund is like the English verbal
noun in _-ing_, as, _loving_; but it lacks a nominative case. For
the nominative the infinitive is used.

  _Nom._ amāre, _to love_, _loving_
  _Gen._ amandī, _of loving_
  _Dat._ amandō, _for loving_
  _Acc._ amandum, _loving_
  _Abl._ amandō, _by loving_

461. *The Uses of the Gerund.* The gerund is used in the various
constructions of nouns. Since it is a _verbal_ noun, it may have
a direct or an indirect object: as, *vincendō hostēs*, _by
overcoming the enemy_; *resistendō hostibus*, _by resisting the
enemy_. Also observe the following:

  1. *Ad pugnandum vēnērunt*, _they came for fighting, for the
    purpose of fighting, to fight_.
  2. *Pugnandī causā vēnērunt*, _they came for the sake of
    fighting, to fight_.

a. Observe that the accusative of the gerund with *ad*, or the
genitive of the gerund with *causā*, is used to express purpose.
*Causā* when so used follows its genitive. This method of

[Illustration: WALL DECORATION OF A ROMAN HOUSE]



LESSON LXIX

THE GERUNDIVE · THE IRREGULAR VERB _FERO_

471. *The Gerundive.* The future passive participle (441, 444) is
more commonly called the _Gerundive_. It is a verbal adjective,
and must be distinguished from the gerund, which is a verbal
noun. The gerund, being a noun, may be used alone or with an
object; but the gerundive, being and adjective, must agree with a
noun.

472. *The Gerundive used in Place of the Gerund.*

  1. *Pācem petendī causā vēnērunt*, _they came for the purpose
    of seeking peace_.
  2. *Pācis petendae causā vēnērunt*, _they came for the purpose
    of seeking peace_.

a. Observe that the Latin sentences have the same meaning, and
that 1 contains a gerund, *petendī*, with an object, *pācem*;
while 2 contains a gerundive, *petendae*, in agreement with
*pācis*. Instead of a gerund with an object, the Romans much
preferred the gerundive construction, except occasionally in the
genitive and in the ablative without a preposition.

473. *The Gerundive used in the Passive Periphrastic
Conjugation.* The gerundive is also used with forms of *sum* as a
predicate adjective. This is known as the _Passive Periphrastic
Conjugation_. For a synopsis see 670.

  1. *Mīles laudandus est*, _the soldier is to be praised, must
    be praised, ought to be praised_.
  2. *Cornēlia laudanda est*, _Cornelia was to be praised, ought
    to be praised, needed to be praised_.

a. Observe that these sentences express necessity. Observe, too,
the methods of translation.

474. *The Irregular Verb _Ferō_.* Learn the principal parts and
the conjugation of the irregular verb *ferō* (666).

THE HELVETIANS LEAVE THEIR TERRITORY

479. Post Orgetorīgis mortem tamen Helvētiī id quod cōnstituerant
facere incēpērunt, ut ē fīnibus suīs exīrent. Ubi iam sē ad eam
rem parātōs esse putāvērunt, oppida sua omnia et vīcōs et prīvāta
aedificia incendērunt. Frūmentum et cibum sibi quemque domō ferre
iussērunt. Persuāsērunt quibusdam cīvitātibus fīnitimīs ut opidīs
suīs vīcīsque incēnsīs cum eīs exīrent.

Erant omnīnō itinera duo quibus itineribus domō exīre poterant:
ūnum per Sēquanōs, angustum et difficile, inter montem Iūram et
flūmen Rhodanum; mōns autem altissimus impendēbat, ut facile
paucī prohibēre possent; alterum per prōvinciam Rōmānam, multō
facilius, quod inter fīnēs Helvētiōrum et Allobrogum, quī nūper
pācātī erant, Rhodanus fluit, isque nōn nūllīs locīs vadō
trānsītur.

Extrēmum oppidum Allogrogum est proximumque Helvētiōrum fīnibus
Genāva. Ex eō oppidō pōns ad Helvētiōs pertinet. Allobrogibus
sēsē vel persuāsūrōs esse vel vī coāctūrōs esse spērābant ut per
suōs fīnēs eōs īre permitterent. Omnibus rēbus parātīs diem
conveniendī dīcunt.

Caesar per nūntiōs audīvit Helvētiōs per prōvinciam nostram iter
facere coepisse. Statim properāvit Rōmā et quam maximīs potuit
itineribus [1] in Galliam ulteriōrem contendit et ad Genāvam
pervēnit. Prōvinciae tōtī quam maximum potuit mīlitum numerum
imperāvit (erat omnīnō in Galliā ulteriōre legiō ūna), pontem quī
erat ad Genāvam iussit rescindī. Ubi dē eius adventū Helvētiī
cognōvērunt, lēgātōs ad eum mīsērunt.

[1] *quam maximīs potuit itineribus*, _by as long journeys as
possible_. Sometimes Cæsar traveled a hundred miles a day.

LESSON LXXI

THE ABLATIVE OF SPECIFICATION · DEPONENT VERBS

480. *The Ablative of Specification.*

  *Gallōs virtūte superant*, _they surpass the Gauls in courage_.

a. Observe that the ablative *virtūte* tells in what respect the
Gauls are surpassed. This usage is known  as the _Ablative of
Specification_.

481. _*Rule for the Ablative of Specification.* The ablative
without a preposition is used to denote in what respect something
is true._

482. *Deponent Verbs.* Deponent verbs are verbs which have
passive forms with active meanings. They occur in each of the
regular conjugations, and are distinguished by the ending of the
present infinitive: first conjugation, *-ārī*; second, *-ērī*;
third, *-ī*,; fourth, *-īrī*. Learn the principal parts, the
meanings, and the conjugation of the deponent verbs in 669.

483. *The Active Forms and the Participles of Deponent Verbs.* A
deponent verb has the following active forms:

  _Fut. Infin._ hortātūrus esse
  _Gerund_ hortandī, etc.

It has the participles of both voices:

  _Pres._ hortāns, _urging_
  _Perfect_ hortātus, _having urged_
  _Fut._ hortātūrus, _about to urge, going to urge_
  _Gerundive_ hortandus, _to be urged_

a. Observe that the perfect participle of deponent verbs is
active in meaning; the gerundive is passive. As the perfect
participle is active in meaning, and ablative absolute (454, b)
is seldom necessary with this participle; instead, the
construction is the same as in English; as,

  *Hortātus mīlitēs signum dedit*, _having encouraged the
    soldiers he gave the signal_, or, _when he had encouraged_,
    etc.

484. VOCABULARY

  *cōnor*, *cōnārī*, *cōnātus sum*, try, attempt (_conative_)
  *experior*, *experīrī*, *expertus sum*, test, make trial of
    (_experience_)
  *hortor*, *hortārī*, *hortātus sum*, urge, entreat
    (_exhortation_)
  *polliceor*, *pollicērī*, *pollicitus sum*, promise, offer

LESSON LXXII

TEMPORAL CLAUSES WITH _CUM_ · THE IRREGULAR VERB _FIO_

487. *Temporal Clauses with _Cum_.* The Latin conjunction *cum*,
_when_, _while_, introduces temporal clauses (XX, e).

  1. *Cum Caesar in Italiā erat, bellum in Galliā ortum est*,
    _when (while) Cæsar was in Italy, a war began in Gaul_.
  2. *Caesar, cum id nūntiātum esset, in Galliam contendit*,
    _Cæsar, when this had been reported, hastened into Gaul_.
  3. *Cum nūntius pervēnerit, Caesar prōgrediētur*, _when the
    messenger arrives, Cæsar will advance_.

a. Observe that the temporal clause in sentence 1 _fixes the
time_ at which the war began, and that its verb is in the
indicative. Observe that the clause in sentence 2 _describes the
circumstances_ under which Cæsar was impelled to hasten into
Gaul, and that its verb is in the subjunctive. Observe that the
temporal clause in sentence 3 _refers to future time_, and that
its verb is in the indicative.

488. _*Rule for Temporal Clauses with Cum.* Temporal clauses
referring to past time, when introduced by *cum*, have their verb
in the indicative if they fix the time of an action, but in the
subjunctive if they describe the circumstances of an action. The
indicative is used in temporal clauses introduced by *cum*
referring to present or to future time._

489. *The Irregular Ver _Fīō_.* The verb *faciō*, which you have
frequently used in the active voice, forms its present system in
the passive from the irregular verb *fīō*. Learn the principal
parts of *fīō* and its conjugation (668). Review the complete
inflection of *faciō*. The passive voice of the compounds of
*faciō* is inflected regularly.

  *Quod eum laudās, mihi grātum est*, _the fact that you praise
    him is pleasing to me_.

a. Observe that the clause *quod eum laudās* is the subject of
*est*. Such clauses, which should be translated by _that_ or _the
fact that_, are called _*Quod* Clauses of Fact_, and have their
verb in the indicative. They are found as the subject of a verb
or in apposition with some word.

496. _*Rule for Substantive Clauses of Fact.* The indicative is
used with *quod* in a substantive clause to state something which
is regarded as a fact._

497. *Adverbial Clauses with the Verb in the Indicative.*

  1. *Ībunt quā iter facillimum est*, _they will go where the way

containing a subordinate clause. The direct statement of both
sentences is the same, *Germānī, quī trāns Rhēnum incolunt, ex
fīnibus ēgrediuntur*. Observe that the subordinate verbs are in
the subjunctive in an indirect statement, and that the tense is
changed according to the rule for the sequence of tenses
(348-351).

502. _*Rule for Subordinate Clauses in Indirect Statements.* The
verbs of the subordinate clauses of an indirect statement are in
the subjunctive. The tense of the subjunctive is decided by the
rule for the sequence of tenses after the verb of *saying*,
*knowing*, etc._

a. Subordinate verbs that were in the subjunctive before they
were indirectly quoted of course remain in the subjunctive.

503. VOCABULARY

  *barbarus*, *-ī*, _m._, barbarian (_barbarous_)

SELECTIONS FOR READING

CÆSAR: THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE HELVETIANS (CONTINUED FROM 494)

_The Helvetians are allowed to proceed through the land of the
Sequani_

514. Helvētiī, eā spē dēiectī, vadīs Rhodanī, quā minima altitūdō
flūminis erat, trānsīre cōnātī sunt, sed mūnītiōne et tēlīs
replusī hōc cōnātū dēstitērunt. Relinquēbātur ūna per Sēquanōs
via. Hīs cum persuādēre nōn possent, lēgātōs ad Dumnorīgem
Haeduum mīsērunt. Dumnorīx apud Sēquanōs plūrimum poterat [1] et
Helvētiīs erat amīcus, quod ex eā cīvitāte Orgetorīgis fīliam in
mātrimōnium dūxerat. Etiam cupiditāte rēgnī adductus est. Itaque
Sēquanīs persuāsit ut per fīnēs suō Helvētiōs īre permitterent et
obsidēs inter sēsē darent: Sēquanī, nē itinere Helvētiōs
prohibērent; Helvētiī, ut sine iniūriā trānsīrent.

_Cæsar opposes this plan of the Helvetians and crosses the Rhone_

515. Caesar certior factus est Helvētiōs cōnstituisse per agrum
Sēquanōrum et Haeduōrum iter in Santonum fīnēs facere, quī nōn
longē ā Tolōsātium fīnibus aberant, quae cīvitās erat in
prōvinciā. Inimīcōs populī Rōmānī eam regiōnem incolere nōlēbat.
Ob eam causam eī mūnītiōnī quam fēcerat Labiēnum lēgātum
praefēcit; ipse in Italiam magnīs itineribus [2] contendit
duāsque ibi legiōnēs cōnscrīpsit, et trēs quae circum Aquilēiam
hiemābant ex hībernīs ēdūxit, et, quā proximum iter in ulteriōrem
Galliam per Alpēs erat, cum hīs quīnque legiōnibus īre contendit.
Ibi quaedam cīvitātēs, locīs superiōribus occupātīs, itinere
exercitum prohibēre cōnātae sunt. Complūribus hīs proeliīs
victīs, [3] ab Ocelō, quod est oppidum citeriōoris prōvinciae [4]
extrēmum, in fīnēs Vocontiōrum ulteriōris prōvinciae diē septimō
pervēnit; inde in Allobrogum fīnēs, ab Allobrogibus in
Seguasiāvōs exercitum dūxit. Hī sunt extrā prōvinciam trāns
Rhodanum prīmī.

_The Hædui and other tribes ask for Cæsar's help against the
Helvetians_

516. Helvētiī interim per fīnēs Sēquanōrum suās cōpiās dūxerant,
et in Haeduōrum fīnēs pervēnerant eōrumque agrōs vāstābant.
Haeduī sē suaque [5] ab eīs dēfendere nōn poterant. Itaque
lēgātōs ad Caesarem mīsērunt ut auxilium rogārent. Eī dīxērunt
paene in cōnspectū exercitūs nostrī agrōs vāstārī, līberōs in
servitūtem abdūcī, oppida expugnārī nōn dēbuisse. [6] Eōdem
tempore Ambarrī Caesarem certiōrem fēcērunt sēsē, vāstātīs agrīs,
nōn facile ab oppidīs vim hostium prohibēre. Item Allobrogēs, quī
trāns Rhodanum vīcōs habēbant, fugā sē ad Caesarem recēpērunt.
Quibus rēbus adductus Caesar diūtius nōn exspectandum esse [7]
cōnstituit.

_Cæsr destroys one division of the Helvetians_

517. Flūmen est Arar, quod per fīnēs Haeduōrum et Sēquanōrum in
Rhodanum fluit. Id Helvētiī trānsībant. Ubi per explōrātōrēs
Caesar certior factus est trēs iam partēs cōpiārum Helvētiōs id
flūmen trādūxisse, quārtam fere partem citrā flūmen Ararim
relictam esse, dē tertiā vigiliā cum legiōnibus tribus ē castrīs
profectus ad eam partem pervēnit quae nōn dum flūmen trānsierat.
Eōs impedītōs adgressus magnam partem interfēcit; reliquī sēsē
fugae mandāvērunt atque in proximās silvās abdidērunt.

_The Helvetians send an embassy to Cæsar_

518. Hōc proliō factō, reliquās cōpiās Helvētiōrum ut cōnsequī
posset, pontem in Ararī [8] fēcit atque ita exercitum trādūxit.
Helvētiī repentīnō eius adventū commōtī, cum illum ūnō diē flūmen
trānsīsse intellegerent, lēgātōs ad eum mīsērunt; cuius
lēgātiōnis Dīvicō prīnceps fuit. In conloquiō Caesar imperāvit ut
obsidēs populō Rōmānō darentur. Dīvicō resondit Helvētiōs obsidēs
accipere, nōn dare cōnsuēvisse. Hōc respōnsō datō discessit.

_Cæsar follows the Helvetians_

519. Posterō diē castra ex eō locō mōvērunt. Idem fēcit Caesar,
equitātumque omnem, ad numerum quattuor mīlium, quem ex omnī
prōvinciā et Haeduīs atque eōrum sociīs coēgerat, praemīsit, ut
vidērent quās in partēs hostēs iter facerent. Quī cupidius
novissimum agmen [9] secūtī aliēnō locō cum equitātū Helvētiōrum
proelium commīsērunt; et paucī dē nostrīs interfectī sunt. Quō
proeliō dēlectātī Helvētiī, quod paucīs equitibus tantam
multitūdinem equitum vīcerant, audācius in nostrōs impetum facere
coepērunt. Caesar suōs ā proeliō continēbat, et ita diēs circiter
XV iter fēcērunt ut inter novissimum hostium agmen et nostrum
prīmum [10] quīnque mīlia passuum interessent.

_Cæsar prepares to attack the Helvetians_

520. Tandem ab explōrātōribus cerior factus est hostēs mīlia
passuum ab ipsīus castrīs octō abesse. Dē tertiā vigiliā Labiēnum
lēgātum cum duābus legiōnibus et eīs ducibus quī iter
cognōverant, summum iugum montis ascendere iussit. Ipse dē quārtā
vigiliā eōdem itinere quō hostēs ierant ad eōs contendit,
equitātumque omnem ante sē mīsit. Cōnsidius cum explōrātōribus
praemissus est.

_Considius becomes panic-stricken_

521. Prīmā lūce, cum summus mōns ā Labiēnō tenērētur, ipse ab
hostium castrīs mīlle passuum abesset, neque (ut posteā ex
captīvīs intellēxit) aut ipsīus adventus aut Labiēnī cognitus
esset, Cōnsidius equō admissō [11] ad eum properāvit. Dīxit
montem quem Caesar ā Labiēnō occupārī voluisset ab hostibus
tenērī; id sē ā Gallicīs armīs cognōvisse. Caesar suās cōpiās ad
proximum collem dūxit et aciem īnstrūxit. Labiēnus interim, monte
occupātō, nostrōs exspectābat. Multō diē [12] per explōrātōrēs
Caesar cognōvit et montem ā suīs tenērī et Helvētiōs castra
mōvisse et Cōnsidium timōre perterritum quod nōn vīdisset prō
vīsō sibi nūntiāvisse. Eō diē, quō cōnsuēverat intervāllō, hostēs
secūtus est et mīlia passuum tria ab eōrum castrīs castra posuit.

_The battle between Cæsar and the Helvetians_

522. Posterō diē cōpiās suās Caesar in proximum collem dūxit
equitātumque, ut sustinēret hostium impetum, mīsit. Ipse interim
in colle mediō aciem legiōnum quattuor īnstrūxit. In summō iugō
duās legiōnēs, quās in Galliā citeriōre proximā aestāte
cōnscrīpserat, et omnia auxilia [13] conlocāvit. Helvētiī cum
omnibus suīs carrīs secūtī impedīmenta in ūnum locum contulērunt;
ipsī sub prīmam nostram aciem successērunt. Caesar hortātus suōs
proelium commīsit. Mīlitēs ē locō superiōre pīlīs missīs in
hostēs impetum fēcērunt. Tandem vulneribus dēfessī hostēs ad
montem, quī circiter mīlle passuum aberat, sē recipere coepērunt.
Diū atque ācriter pugnāvērunt. Diūtius cum sustinēre nostrōrum
impetūs nōn possent, alterī sē, ut coeperant, in montem
recēpērunt, alterī [14] ad impedīmenta et carrōs suōs iērunt. Ad
multam noctem [15] etiam ad impedīmenta contendērunt, quod
Helvētiī prō vāllō carrōs conlocāverant et ē locō superiōre in
nostrōs venientēs tēla coniciēbant. Tandem nostrī impedīmenta et
castra cēpērunt. Ibi Orgetorīgis fīlia atque ūnus ē fīliīs captus
est.

_The Helvetians retreat and offer to surrender_

523. Ex eō proeliō circiter hominum mīlia CXXX superfuērunt,
eāque tōtā nocte continenter iērunt. In fīnēs Lingonum diē quārtō
pervēnērunt. Nostrī autem propter vulnera mīlitum eōs sequī nōn
potuērunt. Caesar litterās nūntiōsque ad Lingonēs mīsit et
imperāvit nē eōs frūmentō nēve aliā rē iuvārent. Ipse trīduō
intermissō cum omnibus cōpiīs eōs sequī coepit.

Helvētiī omnium rērum inopiā adductī lēgātōs dē dēditiōne ad eum
mīsērunt. Quī cum eum in itinere convēnissent sēque ad pedēs [16]
prōiēcissent pācemque petīssent atque eōs in eō locō quō tum
erant suum adventum exspectāre iussisset, pāruērunt. Eō cum
Caesar pervēnisset, obsidēs et arma postulāvit. Obsidibus
armīsque trāditīs, eōs in dēditiōnem accēpit. Helvētiōs in fīnēs
suōs, unde erant profectī, revertī iussit. Id eā maximē ratiōne
fēcit, quod nōluit eum locum unde Helvētiī discesserant vacāre,
nē propter bonitātem agrōrum Germānī, quī trāns Rhēnum incolunt,
ex suīs fīnibus in Helvētiōrum fīnēs trānsīrent et fīnitimī
Galliae prōvinciae Allobrogibusque essent.

CÆSAR: THE STORY OF THE ADUATUCI

_The Aduatuci prepare to make a desperate resistance to Cæsar_

524. Aduatucī [1] cum omnibus cōpiīs auxiliō [2] Nerviīs
veniēbat. Hāc pugnā [3] nūntiātā, ex itinere domum revertērunt;
omnibus oppidīs castellīsque dēsertīs sua omnia in ūnum oppidum
ēgregiē nātūrā mūnītum contulērunt. Quod [4] ex omnibus in
circuitū partibus [5] altissimās rūpēs habēbat, sed ūnā ex parte
aditus relinquēbātur. Quem locum duplicī altissimō mūrō mūnierant
et magna saxa in mūrō conlocābant.

_From their walls they taunt the Romans_

525. Prīmō adventū exercitūs nostrī [6] crēbrās ēruptiōnēs
faciēbant parvīsque proeliīs cum nostrīs contendēbant. Posteā,
vāllō crēbrīsque castellīs ā Rōmānīs circummūnītī, oppidō [7] sē
continēbant. Ubi, vīneīs āctīs [8] aggere extrūctō, turrim [9]
procul cōnstituī vīdērunt, prīmum inrīdēre ex mūrō atque
increpitāre vōcibus [10] coepērunt, quod tanta māchinātiō ab
tantō spatiō [11] īnstruēbātur. Rogāvērunt quibus manibus aut
quibus vīribus tantulī [12] hominēs tantam turrim in mūrō [13]
conlocāre possent.

_But they lose confidence and offer to surrender_

526. Ubi turrim movērī [14] et appropinquāre mūrīs vīdērunt, novā
speciē commōtī, lēgātōs ad Caesarem dē pāce mīsērunt, quī ad hunc
modum locūtī [15] sunt: Audatucōs nōn exīstimāre Rōmānōs sine
auxiliō deōrum bellum gerere, quod tantās māchinātiōnēs tantā
celeritāte movēre possent; itaque sē suaque omnia eōrum potestātī
permissūrōs esse. Ūnum [16] petēbant, nē Caesar sē armīs
prīvāret. Omnēs ferē fīnitimī erant inimīcī, ā quibus sē
dēfendere armīs trāditīs nōn poterant. Mālēbant quamvīs fortūnam
[17] ā populō Rōmānō patī quam ab inimīcīs interficī.

_Cæsar says they must disarm, but promises them protection_

527. Ad haec Caesar respondit: Magis cōnsuētūdine suā [18] quam
meritō eōrum cīvitātem sē cōnservātūrum esse; sed dēditiōnis
nūllam esse condiciōnem nisi [19] armīs trāditīs; id quod in [20]
Nerviīs fēcisset factūrum esse, et fīnitimīs imperātūrum esse nē
iniūriam eīs īnferrent. Rē nūntiātā ad suōs, quae imperārentur sē
factūrōs esse dīxērunt. Armōrum tanta multitūdō dē mūrō in fossam
quae erat ante oppidum iacta est ut prope summam mūrī aggerisque
altitūdinem [21] acervī eōrum adaequārent, et tamen circiter pars
tertia, ut posteā cognōvit Caesar, cēlāta [22] atque in oppidō

_A brave dash for freedom, with a tragic ending_

528. Sub vesperum Caesar portās claudī mīlitēsque ex oppidō exīre
iussit. Oppidānī, quod dēditiōne factā nostrōs [23] praesidia
dēductūrōs crēdiderant, tertiā vigiliā, quā facilis ad nostrās
mūnītiōnēs ascēnsus vidēbātur, omnibus cōpiīs subitō ex oppidō
ēruptiōnem fēcērunt. Celeriter, ut Caesar ante imperāvat, ignibus
[24] signō factō, ex proximīs castellīs eō nostrī properāvērunt.
Ācreter hostēs pugnābant in extrēmā spē salūtis [25] inīquō locō
contrā nostrōs, quī ex vāllō turribusque tēla iaciēbant.
Interfectīs ad [26] hominum mīlibus quattuor, reliquōs in oppidum
nostrī reiēcērunt. Posterō diē, intrōmissīs mīlitibus nostrīs,
sectiōnem eius oppidī ūniversam Caesar vēndidit. [27] Ab eīs
ēmerant capitum [28] numerus ad eum relātus est mīlium
quīnquāgintā trium. [29]

[Illustration: WITH THE ROMANS AT THE FRONT]

[1] The Aduatuci lived about the river Mosa (Meuse), in what is
now Belgium.

[2] _for an aid_ = _to aid_. What use of the case?

[3] The reference is to a battle in which the Nervii had been
almost annihilated.

[4] _this town_.

[5] *ex . . . partibus*, _from all parts in a circuit_ = _all
around_.

[6] *prīmō . . . nostrī*, _as soon as our army got there_. What
literally?

[7] *oppidō* = *in oppidō*.

[8] *vīneīs āctīs*, _the vineæ had been brought up_. These vineæ
were wooden sheds, open in front and rear, used to protect men
who were building an agger, undermining a wall, or filling up a
ditch in front of fortifications. They were about eight feet
high, of like width, and double that length, covered with raw
hides to protect them from being set on fire, and moved on wheels
or rollers.

[9] *turrim* = *turrem*.

[10] *increpitāre vōcibus*, _taunt_. What literally?

[11] *ab tantō spatiō*, _so far away_.

[12] To the taller Belgians the Romans looked like "little
chaps."

[13] The Aduatuci, unacquainted with Roman siege operations,
supposed the Romans intended to hoist the tower upon their wall.

[14] _was moving_.

[15] From *loquor*.

[16] _one thing_, namely, *nē . . . prīvāret*.

[17] *quamvīs fortūnam*, _any fate whatsoever_.

[18] _according to his custom_.

[19] *nisi* is to be translated with the ablative absolute *armīs
trāditīs*, _unless their arms were given up_.

[20] _in the case of_.

[21] *summam . . . altitūdinem*, _top_.

[22] Supply *est*.

[23] *nostrōs*, _our commanders_.

[24] _by fires_.

[25] *in . . . salūtis*, _as their last chance of saving
themselves_. What literally?

[26] _about_, an adverb.

[27] *sectiōnem . . . vēndidit*, _Cæsar sold the whole town (the
people and their property) as booty_.

[28] _souls_. We say so many "head" of cattle.

[29] *relātus . . . trium*, _was reported to be 53,000_. These
53,000 captives were probably driven to the Province or the Italy
and sold in lots to suit purchasers, there to wear out their
lives in bondage.



STORIES OF HERCULES

_The infant Hercules_

529. Herculēs, Alcmēnae fīlius, ōlim in Graeciā habitābat. Hic
dīcitur omnium hominum validissimus fuisse. Sed Iūnō, rēgīna
deōrum, Alcmēnam nōn amāvit et Herculem, quī adhūc īnfāns erat,
interficere voluit. Mīsit igitur duo serpentīs saevissimōs, quī
mediā nocte in cubiculum Alcmēnae vēnērunt, ubi Herculēs cum
frātre dormiēbat. Nōn tamen in cūnīs sed in scūtō magnō
dormiēbant. Serpentēs iam appropinquāverant et scūtum movēbant.
Itaque puerī ē somnō excitātī sunt.

Īphiclēs, frāter Herculis, magnā vōce auxilium petiit; at
Herculēs ipse parvīs manibus serpentēs statim prehendit et colla
eōrum mangā vī compressit. Hōc modō serpentēs ā puerō interfectī
sunt. Alcmēna autem, māter puerōrum, clāmōre audītō, marītum ē
somnō excitāverat. Ille lūmen accendit et gladium rapuit ad
auxilium ferendum; tum ad puerōs properāvit, sed, ubi ad locum
vēnit, rem mīram vīdit, Herculēs enim rīdēbat et serpentēs
interfectōs dēmōnstrābat.

_Hercules studies music_

530. Herculēs ā puerō (_from boyhood_) corpus dīligenter
exercēbat; magnam partem diēī in palaestrā cōnsūmēbat; didicit
etiam arcum intendere et tēla conicere. Hīis exercitātiōnibus
vīrēs eius cōnfirmātae sunt. In mūsicā ā Linō centaruō
ērudiēbātur. Hī centaurī equī erant, sed caput hominis habēbant.
Huic artī nōn dīligenter Herculēs studēbat. Hāc rē cognitā, Linus
puerum reprehendēbat, quod nōn studiōsus erat. Tum Herculēs, īrā
commōtus, citharam subitō rapuit, et omnibus vīribus caput
magistrī īnfēlīcis percussit. [1] Ille ictū prōstrātus [2] est,
et paulō post ē vītā excessit, neque quisquam posteā id officium
suscipere voluit.

_Hercules consules the oracle_

531. Herculēs post paucōs annōs cōnstituit ad ōrāculum Delphicum
īre, hoc enim ōrāculum erat omnium celeberrimum. Ibi templum erat
Apollinis plūrimīs dōnīs ōrnātum. Hōc in templō sedēbat fēmina
quaedam, Pȳthia, et cōnsilium dabat iīs quī ad ōrāculum
veniēbant. Haec autem fēmina ab ipsō Apolline docēbātur et
voluntātem deī hominibus ēnūntiābat. Herculēs igitur, quī
Apollinem maximē colēbat, hūc vēnit. Pȳthia iussit eum ad urbem
Tīryntha īre et Eurystheī rēgis omnia imperāta facere. Hīs
audītīs, Herculēs ad illam urbem contendit, et Eurystheō rēgī sē
in servitūtem trādidit. Duodecim annōs in servitūte Eurystheī
tenēbātur, et duodecim labōrēs quōs ille imperāverat cōnfēcit,
hōc enim ūnō modō tantum scelus [3] expiārī potuit. Dē hīs
labōribus plūrima ā poētīs scrīpta sunt. Multa tamen quae poētae
nārrant vix crēdibilia sunt.

_The Golden apples of the Hesperides_

532. Eurystheus labōrem ūndecimum Herculī imposuit graviōrem quam
eōs quōs anteā imperāverat. Imperāvit enim eī ut aurea pōma ex
hortō Hesperidum ferret. Hesperidēs autem nymphae erant quaedam
pulcherrimae, quae in terrā longinquā habitābant et quibus aurea
quaedam pōma ā Iūnōne commissa erant. Multī hominēs, aurī
cupiditāte inductī, haec pōma auferre iam anteā cōnātī erant. Rēs
tamen difficillima erat, nam hortus in quō pōma erant mūrō
ingentī undique circumdatus est; praetereā dracō quīdam, quī
centum capita habuit, portan hortī dīligenter custōdiēbat. Opus
igitur quod Eurystheus Herculī imperāverat erat difficillimum,
nōn sōlum ob causās quās memorāvimus, sed etiam quod Herculēs
omnīnō ignōrābat quō in locō hortus situs esset.

_Atlas, who upheld the heavens_

533. Herculēs quiētem vehementer cupiēbat, sed cōnstituit
Eurystheō pārēre; et, cum iussa eius accēpisset, proficīscī
mātūrāvit. Ā multīs mercātōribus quaesīvit quō in locō Hesperidēs
habitārent; nihil tamen certum reperīre potuit. Frūstrā per
multās terrās iter fēcit et multa perīcula subiit. Tandem, cum in
hīs itineribus tōtum annum cōnsūmpsisset, ad extrēmam partem
orbis, quae proxima erat Ōceanō, pervēnit. Hīc stābat vir quīdam,
nōmine Atlās, quī caelum umerīs sustinēbat, nē in terram
dēcideret. Herculēs, tantum labōrem, magnopere mīrātus, paulō
post in conloquium cum Atlante vēnit, et, cum causam itineris
docuisset, auxilium ab eō petiit.

_Hercules takes the place of Atlas_

534. Atlās autem potuit Herculem maximē iuvāre, ille enim erat
pater Hesperidum et bene scīvit quō in locō esset hortus. Cum
igitur audīvisset quam ob causam Herculēs vēnisset, dīxit "Ipse
ad hortum ībō, et fīliābus [4] meīs persuādēbō ut pōma suā sponte
[5] trādant." Herculēs, cum haec audīvisset, magnopere gāvīsus
est, [6] nōluit enim vim adhibēre; cōnstituit igitur oblātum [7]
auxilium accipere. Atlās tamen postulāvit ut, dum ipse abesset
(_while he was himself away_), Herculēs caelum umerīs sustinēret.
Hoc negōtium Herculēs libenter suscēpit et, quamquam rēs
difficillima erat, tōtum pondus caelī continuōs complūrīs diēs
sōlus sustinuit.

_The return of Atlas_

535. Atlās intereā abierat [8] et ad hortum Hesperidum, quī pauca
mīlia passuum aberat, sē quam celerrimē [9] contulerat. Eō cum
vēnisset, causam veniendī exposuit et fīliās vehementer hortātus
est ut pōma trāderent. Illae diū haerēbant, nōlēbant enim hoc
facere, quod ab ipsā Iūnōne, ut ante dictum est, hoc mūnus
accēperant. Atlās tamen post multa verba eīs persuāsit ut sibi
[10] pārērent, et pōma ad Herculem rettulit. Herculēs intereā,
cum plūrīs diēs exspectāvisset, neque ūllam fāmam dē reditū
Atlantis accēpisset, hāc morā graviter commōtus est. Tandem
quīntō diē Atlantem reduntem [11] vīdit et mox magnō cum gaudiō
pōma accēpit; tum, postquam grātiās prō tantō beneficiō ēgit, in
Graeciam proficīscī mātūrāvit.

_Nessus, the Centaur_

536. Post haec Herculēs multa alia praeclāra perfēcit, quae nunc
perscrībere [12] longum est. [13] Tandem aetāte prōvectus [14]
Dēĭanīram, Oeneī fīliam, in mātrimōnium dūxit; [15] post tamen
trēs annōs puerum quendam, nōmine [16] Eunomum, cāsū interfēcit.
Dum tamen iter faciunt, ad flūmen quoddam pervēnērunt, quod nūllō
ponte iūnctum erat, et, dum quaerunt quō modō flūmen trāicerent,
accurrit centaurus quīdam, nōmine Nessus, quī auxilium viātōribus
obtulit. Herculēs igitur uxōrem in tergum Nessī imposuit; tum
ipse flūmen nandō [17] trānsiit, quā flūmen angustissimum erat.
At Nessus, paulum in aquam prōgressus, ad rīpam subitō revertit
et Dēĭanīram auferre cōnābātur. Quod cum animadvertisset [18]
Herculēs, īrā graviter commōtus, arcum intendit et pectus Nessī
sagittā trānsfīxit.

_The poisoned robe_

537. Nessus igitur sagittā Herculis trānsfīxus humī (_on the
ground_) iacēbat; at, nē occāsiōnem suī ulcīscendī dīmitteret,
ita locūtus est: "Sī vīs amōrem marītī tuī cōnservāre, aliquid
huius sanguinis, quī ē pectore meō effunditur, sūmēs et repōnēs.
Tum sī quandō suspīciō in mentem tuam vēnerit, [19] vestem marītī
hōc sanguine īnficiēs." Haec locūtus, Nessus animam efflāvit;
Dēĭanīra autem, nihil malī [20] suspicāta, imperāta fēcit. Post
breve tempus Herculēs bellum contrā Eurytum, rēgem propinquum,
suscēpit et, cum rēgem ipsum cum fīliīs interfēcisset, Iolēn,
fīliam Eurytī, captīvam redūxit. Antequam tamen domum vēnit,
nāvem ad Cēnaeum prōmunturium appulit et, in terram ēgressus,
āram cōnstituit, ut Iovī sacrificāret. Dum tamen sacrificium
parat, Licham, comitem suum, domum mīsit ut vestem albam
referret; mōs enim erat apud antīquōs vestem albam gerere [21]
cum sacrificia facerent. At Dēĭanīra, verita [12] Iolēn, vestem,
priusquam Licae dedit, sanguine Nessī īnfēbit.

_The death of Hercules_

538. Herculēs, nihil malī suspicātus, vestem quam Lichās attulit
statim induit; post tamen breve tempus dolōrem per omnia membra
sēnsit, et quae causa eius reī esset magnopere mīrābātur. Dolōre
paene exanimātus vestem dētrahere cōnātus est; illa tamen in
corpore haesit neque ūllō modō dīvellī potuit. Tum dēmum
Herculēs, quasi furōre impulsus, in montem Oetam sē contulit et
in rogum, quem summā celeritāte exstrūxerat, sē imposuit. Quod
cum fēcisset, eōs quī circumstābant ōrāvit ut rogum quam
celerrimē accenderent. Omnēs diū recūsābant; tandem tamen pāstor
quīdam, ad misericordiam inductus, ignem subdidit. Tum, dum omnia
fūmō obscūrantur, Herculēs dēnsā nūbe vēlātus ā Iove in Olympum
abreptus est.

[1] From *percutiō*.

[2] From *prōsternō*.

[3] The murdering of his own children.

[4] The ending *-ābus* is regularly used for the dative and
ablative plural of *dea* and of *fīlia*.

[5] *suā sponte*, _of their own accord_.

[6] *gāvīsus est*, from *gaudeō*, which is deponent in the
perfect system.

[7] From *offerō*.

[8] From *abeō*. From what verb does *aberat* come?

[9] *quam celerrimē*, _as quickly as possible_. *Quam* with a
superlative usually has the force _as . . . as possible_ (see p.
185, note 1).

[10] *sibi* is an indirect reflexive here, and refers to the
subject of *persuāsit* rather than to that of *pārērent*.

[16] See 481.

[17] From *nō*; _by swimming_; see 460.

preceding sentence is commonly translated by a personal or
demonstrative pronoun.

[19] *vēnerit*, _shall have come_; but it is better translated
_comes_.

[20] Partitive genitive with *nihil*; _nothing of evil_ = _no
evil_.

[21] *gerere*, _to wear_; subject of *erat*.

[22] *verita*, _fearing_; the perfect participle of some deponent
verbs is often translated like a present participle.



STORIES OF ULYSSES

_Polyphemus, the one-eyed giant_

539. Ulixēs comitēsque, postquam tōtam noctem rēmīs contenderant,
ad terram ignōtam nāvem appulērunt; tum, quod nātūram eius
regiōnis ignōrābat, ipse Ulixēs, cum duodecim ē sociīs in terram
ēgressus, locum explōrāre cōnstituit. Paulum ā lītore prōgressī,
ad antrum ingēns pervēnērunt, quod habitārī sēnsērunt, eius enim
introitum arte et manibus [1] mūnītum esse animadvertērunt. Mox,
etsī intellegēbant sē nōn sine perīculō id factūrōs esse, antrum
intrāvērunt. Quod cum fēcissent, magnam cōpiam lactis invēnērunt
in vāsis ingentibus conditam. Dum tamen mīrantur quis eam sēdem
incoleret, sonitum terribilem audīvērunt, et oculīs ad portam
versīs, mōnstrum horribile vīdērunt, quod hūmānam speciem et
figūram sed corpus ingēns habuit. Cum autem animadvertissent
gigantem ūnum tantum [2] oculum habēre in mediā fronte positum,
intellēxērunt hunc esse ūnum ē Cyclōpibus, dē quibus fāmam iam
accēperant.

_The giant's supper_

540. Cyclōpēs autem pāstōrēs erant quīdam, quī īnsulam Siciliam
et praecipuē montem Aetnam incolēbant; ibi enim Vulcānus, praeses
fabrōrum et ignis repertor, cuius servī Cyclōpēs erant, officīnam
habēbat. Graecī igitur, simul ac mōnstrum vīdērunt, terrōre paene
exanimātī, in interiōrem partem spēluncae refūgērunt et sē ibi
cēlāre cōnābantur. Polyphēmus autem (ita enim gigās appellātus
est) pecora sua in spēluncam ēgit; tum, cum saxō ingentī portam
obstrūxisset, ignem mediō in antrō accendit. Hōc factō, omnia
oculō perlūstrābat, et cum sēnisset hominēs in interiōre parte
antrī cēlārī, magnā vōce exclāmāvit: "Quī estis hominēs?
Mercātōrēs an latrōnēs?" Tum Ulixēs respondit sē neque mercātōrēs
esse neque praedandī causā vēnisse, sed ā Trōiā reduentēs, [3] vī
tempestātum ā rēctō cursū dēplusōs esse; ōrāvit etiam ut sē sine
iniūriā dīmitteret. Tum Polyphēmus quaesīvit ubi nāvis eōrum
esset. Ulixēs autem respondit nāvem in rūpēs coniectam et omnīnō
perfrāctam [4] esse. Polyphēmus, nūllō respōnsō datō, duo ē
sociīs manū corripuit et membrīs eōrum dīvulsīs [5] carnem [6]
dēvorāre coepit.

_No way of escape_

541. Dum haec geruntur, Graecōrum animōs tantus terror occupāvit
ut nē vōcem quidem ēdere possent, sed, omnī spē salūtis dēpositā,
mortem praesentem exspectārent. At Polyphēmus, postquam famēs hāc
tam horribilī cēnā dēpulsa est, humī (_on the ground_) prōstrātus
somnō sē dedit. Quod cum vīdisset Ulixēs, arbitrātus est mōnstrum
interficiendum esse. Prīmum cōnstituit explōrāre quā ratiōne ex
antrō ēvādere possent. At, cum saxum animadvertisset quō
introitus obstrūctus erat, intellēxit mortem Polyphēmī auxiliō
sibi nōn futūram esse. Tanta enim erat eius saxī magnitūdō ut nē
ā decem quidem hominibus āmovērī posset. Ulixēs igitur hōc cōnātū
dēstitit et ad sociōs rediit; quī, cum intellēxissent quō in locō
[7] rēs esset, nūllā spē salūtis oblātā, dē fortūnis suīs
dēspērāre coepērunt. Ille tamen vehementer hortātus est nē animōs
dēmitterent, [8] et dēmōnstrāvit sē ipsōs iam anteā ē multīs et
magnīs perīculīs ēvāsisse.

_A plan for vengeance_

542. Ortā lūce [9] Polyphēmus, iam ē somnō excitātus, idem quod
[10] hesternō diē fēcit, correptīs enim duōbus ē reliquīs virīs
carnem eōrum sine morā dēvorāvit. Tum, cum saxum āmōvisset, ipse
cum pecore ex antrō prōgressus est. Quod cum vidērunt Graecī,
magnam in spem vēnērunt [11] sē post paulum ēvāsūrōs. Mox tamen
ab hāc spē repulsī sunt, nam Polyphēmus, postquam omnēs ovēs
exiērunt, saxum in locum restituit. Graecī, omnī spē salūtis
dēpositā, lāmentīs lacrimīsque sē dēdidērunt. Ulixēs vērō, quī,
ut suprā dēmōnstrāvimus, vir fortis fuit, etsī bene intellegēbat
rem in discrīmine esse, nōndum omnīnō dēspērābat. Tandem,
postquam diū tōtō animō cōgitāvit, hoc cēpit cōnsilium. Ē lignīs
quae in antrō reposita sunt pālum magnum dēlēgit; hunc summā cum
dīligentiā praeacūtum fēcit; tum, postquam sociīs quid [12] fierī
vellet ostendit, reditum Polyphēmī exspectābat.

_Polyphemus thrice drains a wine bowl_

543. Sub vesperum Polyphēmus ad antrum rediit et eōdem modō quō
anteā cēnāvit. Tum Ulixēs ūtrem vīnī prōmpsit, [13] quem forte,
ut in tālibus rēbus saepe accidit, sēcum attulerat, et postquam
magnam crātēram vīnō replēvit, gigantem ad bibendum prōvocāvit.
Polyphēmus, quī numquam anteā vīnum gustāverat, tōtam crātēram
statim hausit. [14] Quod cum fēcisset, tantam voluptātem percēpit
ut iterum et tertium crātēram replērī iubēret. Tum, cum
quaesīvisset quō nōmine Ulixēs appellārētur, ille respondit sē
Nēminem [15] appellārī. Quod cum audīvisset Polyphēmus, ita
locūtus est: "Ut tibī grātiam prō tantō beneficiō referam, tē
ultimum omnium dēvorābō." Hīs dictīs, cibō vīnōque gravātus
recubuit [16] et post breve tempus somnō oppressus est. Tum
Ulixēs, sociīs convocātīs, dīxit: "Habēmus quam petiimus
facultātem. [17] Tanta occāsiō nōn omittenda est."

_Noman_

544. Hāc ōrātiōne habitā, postquam extrēmum pālum [18]
ignīcalefēcit, oculum Polyphēmī, dum dormit, flagrante lignō
trānsfōdit. Quō factō, omnēs in dīversās spēluncae partīs sē
abdidērunt. At ille subitō illō dolōre, quod necesse fuit, [19],
ē somnō excitātus, clāmōrem teribilem sustulit, [20] et dum per
spēluncam errat, Ulixī manum inicere cōnābātur. Hoc tamen, quod
iam omnīnō caecus erat, nūllō modō efficere potuit. Intereā
reliquī Cyclōpēs, clāmōre audītō, undique ad spēluncam
convēnērunt, et apud introitum adstantēs, quid Polyphēmus ageret
[21] quaesīvērunt et quam ob causam tantum clāmōrem sustulisset.
Ille respondit sē graviter vulnerātum esse et magnō dolōre
adficī. Cum tamen cēterī quaesīvissent quis eī [22] vim
intulisset, respondit ille Nēminem id fēcisse. Hōc audītō,
Cyclōpēs, eum in īnsāniam incidisse arbitrātī, [23] abiērunt.

_The escape_

545. Sed Polyphēmus, cum sociōs suōs abiisse sēnisset, furōre
atque āmentiā impulsus, Ulixem iterum quaerere coepit. Tandem cum
portam invēnisset, saxum quō obstrūcta [24] erat āmōvit, ut pecus
ad agrōs exīret. Tum ipse in introitū sēdit, et cum quaeque ovis
ad locum vēnerat, tergum eius manibus tractābat, nē virī inter
ovēs exīre possent. Quod cum animadvertisset Ulixēs, hoc
cōnsilium iniit, bene enim intellēxit omnem spem salūtis iam in
dolō magis quam in virtūte pōnī. Prīmum trēs quās vīdit
pinguissimās ex ovibus dēlēgit. Quibus inter sē [25] vīminibus
cōnexīs, [26] ūnum ex sociīs ventribus eōrum ita subiēcit ut
omnīnō latēret; deinde ovīs hominem sēcum ferentēs ad portam
ēgit. Id accidit quod fore [26] suspicātus erat. Polyphēmus enim,
postquam manūs tergīs eōrum imposuit, ovīs praeterīre passus [27]
est. Ulixēs, postquam rem fēlīciter ēvēnisse vīdit, omnēs sociōs
suōs ex ōrdine eōdem modō ēmīsit; quō factō, ipse ultimus ēvāsit.

_Out of danger_

546. Hīs rēbus ita cōnfectīs, Ulixēs cum sociīs quam celerimē ad
lītus contendit. Quō [28] cum vēnissent, ab eīs quī praesidiō
nāvī relictī erant magnā cum laetitiā acceptī sunt. Hī enim, cum
iam anxiīs animīs trēs di reditum eōrum in hōrās [29]
exspectāvissent, eōs in perīculum grave incidisse suspicātī, ipsī
auxiliandī causā ēgredī parābant. Tum Ulixēs, nōn satis tūtum
esse arbitrātus in eō locō manēre, quam celerrimē proficīscī
cōnstituit. Iussit igitur omnēs nāvem cōnscendere, et, ancorīs
sublātis, paulum ā lītore in altum prōvectus est. Tum magnā vōce
exclāmāvit: "Tū, Polyphēme, [30] quī iūra hospitī spernis, iūstam
et dēbitam poenam immānitātis tuae solvistī." Hāc vōce audītā,
Polyphēmus, īrā vehementer commōtus, ad mare sē contulit, et ubi
intellēxit nāvem paulum ā lītore remōtam esse, saxum ingēns
correptum in eam partem coniēcit unde vōcem venīre sēnsit. Graecī
autem, nūllō damnō acceptō, cursum tenuērunt.

EUTROPIUS: HISTORY OF ROME [1]

_The founding of Rome by Romulus_

547. Rōmānum imperium [2] ā Rōmulō initium habet, quī Rhēae
Silviae fīlius et Mārtis erat. Is decem et octō annōs nātus urbem
parvam in Palātīnō monte [3] cōnstituit. Conditā cīvitāte, quam
ex nōmine suō Rōmam vocāvit, haec ferē ēgit. [4] Multitūdinem
fīnitimōrum in cīvitātem recēpit, centum ex seniōribus [5] lēgit,
quōrum cōnsiliō omnia agēbat, quōs senātōrēs nōmināvit propter
senectūtem. Tum, cum uxōrēs ipse et populus suus nōn habērent,
[6] invītāvit ad spectāculum lūdōrum vīcīnās urbī Rōmae nātiōnēs
atque eārum virginēs rapuit. Commītīs bellīs propter raptārum [7]
iniūriam Caenīnēnsēs vīcit, Antemnātēs, Crustumīnōs, Sabīnōs, [8]
Fīdēnātēs, Vēientēs. Haec omnia oppida urbem cingunt. Et cum,
ortā subitō tempestāte, nōn compāruisset, [9] annō rēgnī
trīcēsimō septimō ad deōs trānsīsse crēditus est et cōnsecrātus.
[10]

_The kings who succeeded Romulus_

548. Posteā Numa Pompilius rēx creātus est, quī bellum quidem
nūllum gessit, sed nōn minus cīvitātī [11] quam Rōmulus prōfuit.
Nam et lēgēs Rōmānīs mōrēsque cōnstituit et annum dēscrīpsit in
decem mēnsēs, et īnfīnīta sacra ac templa cōnstituit.

Huic successit Tullus Hostīlius. Hic bella reparāvit, Albānōs
vīcit; Vēientēs et Fīdēnātēs bellō superāvit; urbem ampliāvit
adiectō Caeliō monte. [12]

Post hunc Ancus Mārcius suscēpit imperium. Contrā Latīnōs
dīmicāvit, Aventīnum montem cīvitātī adiēcit et Iāniculum; apud
ōstium Tiberis cīvitātem condidit.

Deinde rēgnum Prīscus Tarquinius accēpit. Hic numerum senātōrum
duplicāvit, circum [13] Rōmae [14] aedificāvit, lūdōs Rōmānōs
[15] īnstituit, quī ad nostram memoriam permanent. Vīcit īdem
etiam Sabīnōs et nōn parum [16] agrōrum urbis Rōmae territōriō
iūnxit, prīmusque triumphāns urbem intrāvit. Mūrōs fēbit et
cloācās, Capitōlium incohāvit.

Post hunc Servius Tullius suscēpit imperium. Hic quoque Sabīnōs
subēgit, montēs trēs, Quirīnālem, Vīminālem, Ēsquilīnum, urbī
adiūnxit, fossās circum mūrum dūxit. Prīmus omnium cēnsum
ōrdināvit, quī adhūc per orbem terrārum incognitus erat. Sub eō
Rōma, omnibus in cēnsum dēlātīs, [17] habuit capita [18] LXXXIII
mīlia cīvium Rōmānōrum cum hīs quī in agrīs erant.

Tarquinius Superbus, septimus atque ultimus rēgem, Volscōs, quae
gēns ad Campāniam euntibus [19] nōn longē ab urbe est, vīcit,
Gabiōs cīvitātem [20] et Suessam Pōmētiam subēgit, cum Tuscīs
pācem fēcit et templum Iovī in Capitōliō [21] aedificāvit. Posteā
Ardeam oppugnāns imperium perdidit; [22] cumque imperāvisset
annōs quattuor et vīgintī, cum uxōre et līberīs suīs fūgit.

_The first consuls_

549. Hinc cōnsulēs coepērunt, prō ūnō rēge duo, hāc causā creātī,
ut, sī ūnus malus esse voluisset, [23] alter eum habēns
potestātem similem coërcēret. Et placuit [24] nē imperium longuis
quam annum habērent, nē per diūturnitātem potestātis
īnsolentiōrēs redderentur. Fuērunt igitur annō prīmō ab expulsīs
rēgibus cōnsulēs Iūnius Brūtus et Tarquinius Collātīnus. Sed
Tarquiniō Collātīnō statim sublāta est dignitās. Placuerat [25]
enim nē quisquam in urbe manēret quī Tarquinius vocārētur. Ergō,
acceptō omnī patrimōniō suō, ex urbe migrāvit, et locō ipsīus
[26] factus est L. Valerius Pūblicola cōnsul.

_Wars against the Tarquins_

550. Commōvit tamen bellum urbī Rōmae rēs Tarquinius, quī fuerat
expulsus, et, collēctīs multīs gentibus, ut in rēgnum posset
restituī, dīmicāvit. In prīmā pugnā Brūtus cōnsul et Arrūns,
Tarquinī fīlius, invicem sē occīdērunt, [27] Rōmānī tamen ex eā
pugnā victōrēs recessērunt. Brūtum mātrōnae Rōmānae quasi
commūnem patrem per annum lūxērunt. [28]

Secundō quoque annō iterum Tarquinius, ut reciperētur in rēgnum,
bellum Rōmānīs [29] intulit, auxilium [30] eī ferente Porsenā,
[31] Tusciae rēge, et Rōmam paene cēpit. Vērum tum quoque victus
est.

Tertiō annō post rēgēs exāctōs Tarquinius, cum suscipī nōn posset
in rēgnum neque eī Porsena, quī pācem cum Rōmānīs fēcerat,
praestāret auxilium, Tusculum sē contulit, quae cīvitās nōn longē
ab urbe est, atque ibi per quattuordecim annōs prīvātus incoluit.

_Pyrrhus and the Romans_

551. Eōdem tempore Tarentīnīs, quī iam in ultimā Italiā sunt,
bellum indictum est, quod lēgātīs Rōmānōrum iniūriam fēcerant. Hī
Pyrrhum, Ēpīrī rēgem, contrā Rōmānōs in auxilium poposcērunt.
[32] Is mox ad Italiam vēnit, tumque prīmum Rōmānī cum
trānsmarīnō hoste dīmicāvērunt. Missus est contrā eum cōnsul P.
Valerius Laevīnus, quī ostendī omnem exercitum, tumque dīmittī,
ut renūntiārent Pyrrhō quae ā Rōmānīs agerentur. Commissā mox
pugnā, cum iam Pyrrhus fugeret, elephantōrum auxiliō vīcit, quōs
incognitōs [33] Rōmānī timuērunt. Sed nox proeliō fīnem dedit;
Laevīnus tamen per noctem fūgit, Pyrrhus Rōmānōs mīlle
octingentōs cēpit et eōs summō honōre trāctāvit, occīsōs
sepelīvit. Quōs cum adversō vulnere [34] et trucī vultū [34]
etiam mortuōs iacēre vīdisset, tulisse ad caelum manūs dīcitur
cum hāc vōce: Sē tōtīus orbis dominum esse potuisse, sī tālēs
sibi mīlitēs contigissent. [35]

Posteā Pyrrhus, coniūnctīs sibi Samnītibus, Lūcānīs, Bruttiīs,
Rōmam perrēxit, [36] omnia ferrō ignīque vāstāvit, Campāniam
populātus est, et ad Praeneste vēnit. Mox terrōre exercitus, quī
eum cum cōnsule sequēbātur, in Campāniam sē recēpit. Lēgātī ad
Pyrrhum dē redimendīs captīvīs missī ab eō bene receptī sunt.
Captīvōs sine pretiō Rōmam mīsit. Ūnum ex lēgātīs Rōmānōrum,
Fabricium, sīc admīrātus, cum eum pauperem esse cognōvisset, ut
quārtā parte rēgnī prōmissā [37] sollicitāre voluerit [38] ut ad
sē trānsīret, contemptusque [39] est ā Fabriciō. Quārē cum
Pyrrhus Rōmānōrum ingentī admīrātiōne tenērētur, [40] lēgātum
mīsit, ut pācem aequīs condiciōnibus peteret, praecipuum virum,
Cīnaem nōmine, ita ut Pyrrhus partem Italiae quam iam armīs
occupāverat obtinēret.

Pāx displicuit remandātum Pyrrhō est [41] ā senātū eum cum
Rōmānīs, nisi ex Italiā recessisset, pācem habēre nōn posse. Ita
lēgātus Pyrrhī reversus est. Ā quō cum quaereret Pyrrhus quālem
Rōmam [42] comperisset, Cīneās dīxit rēgum sē patriam vīdisse:
tālēs illīc ferē omnēs esse, quālis ūrius Pyrrhus apud Ēpīrum
[43] et reliquam Graeciam putārētur.

Missī sunt contrā Pyrrhum ducēs P. Sulpicius et Decius Mūs
cōnsulēs. Certāmine commissō Pyrrhus vulnerātus est, elephantī
interfectī, vīgintī mīlia caesa [44] hostium, et ex Rōmānīs
tantum quīnque mīlia; Pyrrhus Tarentum fugātus. [45]

Interiectō annō contrā Pyrrhum Fabricius est missus, quī prius
inter lēgātōs sollicitārī nōn poterat, quārtā rēgnī parte
prōmissā. Tum, cum vīcīna castra ipse et rēx habērent, medicus
Pyrrhī nocte ad eum vēnit, prōmittēns venēnō sē Pyrrhum
occīsūrum, sī sibi aliquid pollicērētur. [46] Quem Fabricius
vīnctum redūcī iussit ad dominum Pyrrhōque dīcī quae contrā caput
eius medicus spopondisset. [47] Tum rēx admīrātus eum dīxisse
fertur: [48] "Ille est Fabricius quī dificilius ab honestāte quam
sōl ā cursū suō āvertī potest." Tum rēx in Siciliam profectus
est.

Cōnsulēs deinde M. Curius Dentātus et Cornēlius Lentulus adversus
Pyrrhum missī sunt. Curius contrā eum pugnāvit, exercitum eius
cecīdit, [49] ipsum Tarentum fugāvit, castra cēpit. Eō diē caesa
hostium vīgintī tria mīlia. Curius in cōnsulātū triumphāvit.
Prīmus Rōmam elephantōs quattuor dūxit. Pyrrhus etiam ā Tarentō
mox recessit et apud Argōs, Graeciae cīvitātem, occīsus est.

era, wrote a brief history of Rome from its founding to the year
364.

[2] *imperium*, _power_, _state_.

[3] *Palātīnō monte*, _the Palatine Hill_, one of the seven hills
on which Rome was built.

[4] *haec ferē ēgit*, _he did about as follows_.

[5] *seniōribus*, _older men_; comparative of *senex*, _old_.

[6] *cum . . . habērent*, _because . . . had_. A causal clause
introduced by *cum*, _because_, _as_, _since_, has its verb in
the subjunctive mood.

[7] Understand *virginum*.

[8] In apposition with *Caenīnēnsēs*, *Antemnātēs*, and
*Crustumīnōs*. Fidenæ and Veii were Etruscan towns.

[9] *nōn compāruisset*, _had disappeared_.

[10] *cōnsecrātus (est)*, _was deified_.

[11] Which use of the dative?

[12] *adiectō Caeliō monte*, _by the additi of the Cælian Hill_.

[13] *circum*, the Circus Maximus, where races and other sports
were held.

[15] The *lūdī Rōmānī* consisted of a variety of games and
contests held each year in September in the Circus Maximus.

[18] See p. 208, note 5.

[20] *Gabiōs cīvitātem*, _the city _(or _community_)_ of Gabii_.

[21] *in Capitōliō*, _on the Capitoline Hill_.

[22] A crime committed by a son of Tarquinius aroused such
indignation that Tarquinius and his family were obliged to leave
Rome.

[23] *sī . . . voluisset*, _if one of the consuls were inclined
to be troublesome_; *voluisset* is attracted into the subjunctive
mood, because it depends on a clause the verb of which is in the
subjunctive.

[24] *placuit*, _it was decided_. The subject is the clause *nē .
. . habērent*.

[25] *placuerat*, _it had been decided_.

ablatives. Translate, _when he saw these men lying with wounds on
the front of their bodies and with stern expressions on their
faces even in death_.

[35] _if it had been his lot to have such soldiers_.

[36] From *pergō*.

[37] *quārtā . . . prōmissā*, _by the offer of a fourth of his
kingdom_.

[38] The perfect subjunctive is often used in result clauses in
secondary sequence.

for the Romans_. How literally? The clause is causal.

[41] *remandātum . . . est*, _word was sent back to Pyrrhus
that_, etc.

[42] *quālem Rōmam*, _what sort of city he had found Rome to be_.

[43] *apud Ēpīrum*, _in Epirus_.

STORIES FROM ROMAN HISTORY

_The brave deed of Hratius Cocles_

552. Porsena, rēx Etrūscōrum, ad restituendō Tarquiniōs cum
īnfestō exercitū vēnit. Prīmō impetū Iāniculum cēpit. Nōn umquam
aliās ante tantus terror Rōmānōs invāserat; ex agrīs in urbem
dēmigrant; urbem ipsam saepiunt praesidiīs. Alia pars urbis
mūrīs, [1] alia Tiberī obiectō [2] tūta vidēbātur. [3] Pōns
Sublicius iter paene hostibus dedit. Ūnus vir autem erat,
Horātius Cocles, illō cognōmine appellātus quod in aliō proeliō
oculum āmīserat. Is, extrēmā pontis parte occupātā, aciem hostium
sōlus sustinuit. Intereā pōns ā tergō interrumpēbātur. Ipsa
audācia obstupefēbit hostīs; ponte rescissō, [4] armātus in
Tiberim dēsiluit et, multīs superincidentibus tēlīs, incolumis ad
suōs trānāvit. Ob virtūtem Horātiō cīvitās grātiam solvit: [5] eī
tantum agrī pūblicē datum est quantum [6] ūnō diē circumarāre
potuit. Statua quoque eī in Comitiō posita est.

_The fortitude of Mucius_

553. Cum Porsena Rōmam obsidēret, Mūcius senātum adiit et veniam
trānsfugiendī [7] petiit, necem rēgis reprōmittēns. Acceptā
potestāte, in castra Porsenae vēnit. Ibi in cōnfertissimā turbā
prope rēgium tribūnal cōnstitit. Stīpendium tunc forte mīlitibus
dabātur, et proximus rēgī erat scrība, quī similem vestem
gerēbat. Mūcius, ignōrāns uter rēx esset, scrībam prō rēge
occīdit. Apprehēnsus et ad rēgem pertrāctus, [8] dextram accēnsō
[9] ad sacrificium foculō iniēcit, velut manum pūniēns. Attonitus
mīrāculō, rēx iuvenem āmovērī ab altāribus iussit. Tum Mūcius,
quasi beneficium remūnerāns, dīxit trecentōs [10] sibi similīs
adversus eum coniūrāvisse. Quā rē ille territus, bellum acceptīs
obsidibus dēposuit.

_Clœia, the hostage, escapes_

554. Porsena Cloeliam, virginem nōbilem, inter obsidēs accēperat.
Castra Porsenae haud procul ab rīpā Tiberis locāta erant.
Cloelia, dēceptīs custōdibus, nocte castrīs ēgressa, equō quem
fors dederat arreptō, [11] Tiberim trāiēcit. Quod ubi rēgī
nūntiātum est, prīmō incēnsus īrā, Rōmam lēgātōs mīsit ad
Cloeliam obsidem reposcendam. Rōmānī eam ex foedere restituērunt.
Tum rēx virginis virtūtem admīrātus [12] eam laudāvit ac partem
obsidum eī datūrum esse sē dīxit, permīsitque ut ipsa obsidēs
legeret. Prōductīs obsidibus, Cloelia virginēs puerōsque ēlēgit,
quōrum aetātem iniūriae obnoxiam [13] sciēbat, et cum eīs in
patriam rediit. Rōmānī novam in fēminā virtūtem novō genere
honōris, statuā equestrī, dōnāvērunt. In summā [14] Viā Sacrā
[15] est posita virgō īnsidēns equō.

_Caius Marcius Coriolanus_

555. C. Mārcius captīs Coriolīs, [16] urbe Volscōrum, Coriolānus
dictus est. Puer patre [17] orbātus sub mātris tūtēlā adolēvit.
Cum prīma stīpendia facere coepisset [18] adulēscēns, ē multīs
proeliīs quibus interfuit numquam rediit nisi corōnā aliōve
mīlitārī praemiō dōnātus. In omnī vītae ratiōne nihil aliud sibi
prōpōnēbat quam ut mātrī placēret; cumque illa audīret fīlium
[19] laudārī aut corōnā dōnārī vidēret, tum dēmum fēlīcem sē ipsa
putābat. Cōnsul factus gravī annōnā [20] advectum [21] ē Siciliā
frūmentum mangō pretiō dandum populō cūrāvit, ut plēbs agrōs, nōn
sēditiōnēs, coleret. Quā de causā damnātus ad Volscōs īnfestōs
tunc Rōmānīs cōnfūgit eōsque adversus Rōmānōs concitāvit.
Imperātor ā Volscīs factus, castrīs ad quārtum ab urbe lapidem
[22] positīs, agrum Rōmānum est populātus.

Missī sunt Rōmā ad Coriolānum lēgātī dē pāce, sed atrōx respōnsum
rettulērunt. Iterum deinde iīdem missī nē in castra quidem
receptī sunt. Stupēbat senātus, trepidābat populus, virī pariter
ac mulierēs exitium imminēns lāmentābantur. Tum Veturia,
Coriolānī māter, et Volumnia uxor, duō parvōs fīliōs sēcum
trahēns, castra hostium petiērunt. Ubi mātrem adspexit
Coriolānus, exclāmāvit: "Ō patria, vīcistī īram meam admōtīs
mātris meae precibus, [23] cui [24] tuam in mē iniūriam condōnō."
Complexus inde suōs castra mōvit et exercitum ex agrō Rōmānō
abdūxit.

  7. A relative pronoun agrees with its antecedent in gender and
    number, but its case depends on the way it is used in its own
    clause (248).

620. *Nominative Case.*

  8. The subject of a verb is in the nominative case (28).

621. *Genitive Case.*

  9. The word denoting the owner or possessor is in the genitive
    case (44).
  10. Words denoting a part may have with them a genitive of the
    whole from which the part is taken (309).
  11. Some nouns of action and feeling may have with them a
    genitive to express the object of the action or feeling
    implied in the nouns (381).
  12. The genitive denotes that of which something consists or is
    made (p. 79, note 1).

622. *Dative Case.*

  13. The indirect object of a verb is in the dative case (57).
  14. Certain adjectives meaning _near_, _fit_, _friendly_,
    _pleasing_, _like_, and their opposites, may be accompanied
    by a dative to show the person or the thing toward which the
    quality of the adjective is directed (111).
  15. Some verbs compounded with *ad*, *ante*, *con*, *dē*, *in*,
    *inter*, *ob*, *post*, *prae*, *prō*, *sub*, and *super*,
    take a dative of the indirect object. Transitive compounds
    may take both an accusative and a dative (425).
  16. The dative is used to denote the purpose for which a thing
    serves (427).
  17. The dative is used to denote the person (or, rarely, the
    thing) affected by the action or situation expressed by the
    verb (428).
  18. Most verbs meaning _believe_, _favor_, _help_, _please_,
    _trust_, and their opposites, also _command_, _obey_,
    _pardon_, _persuade_, _resist_, _serve_, _spare_, and the
    like, take a dative of the indirect object (433).

623. *Accusative Case.*

  19. The object of a verb is in the accusative case (33).
  20. Place _to which_ is usually expressed by the accusative
    with *ad* or *in*; but with the names of towns, and with
    *domus*, the preposition is omitted (230, b).
  21. The accusative is used with certain prepositions (193).
  22. Extent of time or of space is expressed by the accusative
    (333).
  23. The subject of the infinitive is in the accusative (399).

624. *Ablative Case.*

  24. Place _where_ is commonly expressed by a phrase consisting
    of a preposition, usually *in*, with the ablative case (59).
  25. The means by which an action is accomplished is expressed
    by the ablative without a preposition (122).
  26. The ablative with *cum* is used with abstract nouns to
    denote the manner of an action; but *cum* may be omitted if
    an adjective modifies the noun of the phrase (129).
  27. The ablative with *cum* is used to show accompaniment
    (143).
  28. Place _from which_ is usually expressed by the ablative
    with *ā (ab)*, *dē*, *ē (ex)*; but with the names of towns,
    and with *domus*, the preposition is omitted (230, a).

  31. The time at which or within which a thing happens is
    expressed by the ablative without a preposition (219).
  32. The personal agent with a passive verb is expressed by the
    ablative with *ā* or *ab* (243).
  33. Words signifying _privation_, _removal_, or _separation_
    are followed by the ablative without a preposition, or with
    the prepositions *ā (ab)*, *dē*, *ē (ex)* (282).
  34. The degree of difference is expressed by the ablative
    (321).
  35. The ablative of a noun or pronoun, with a participle, a
    noun, or an adjective in agreement, is used to express
    _time_, _cause_, _concession_, _condition_, or other
    relations (455).
  36. The ablative without a preposition is used to denote in
    what respect something is true (481).

625. *Adverbial Clauses.*

  37. The cause of an action may be expressed by a dependent
    clause introduced by *quod* (51).
  38. The subjunctive is used with *ut* or *nē* in a dependent
    clause to express the purpose of the action stated in the
    independent clause (344).
  39. The subjunctive is used with *ut* or *ut nōn* in a
    dependent clause to express the result of the action stated
    in the independent clause (358).
  40. Temporal clauses referring to past time, when introduced by
    *cum*, have their verb in the indicative if they fix the time
    of an action, but in the subjunctive if they describe the
    circumstances of an action (488).
  41. Adverbial clauses introduced by *quā* and *ut* (= _as_)
    have their verbs in the indicative (497).

626. *Adjective Clauses.*

  42. A relative clause modifies its antecedent as an adjective
    modifies its noun (247, b).

627. *Substantive Clauses.*

  43. Verbs meaning _ask_, _command_, _persuade_, and _urge_ may
    have for their object a clause of purpose with its verb in
    the subjunctive (356).
  44. An indirect question, with its verb in the subjunctive, may
    be used as the subject or the object of another verb (372,
    b).
  45. An infinitive with subject accusative may be used as the
    subject of another verb (393).
  46. An infinitive with subject accusative may be used as the
    object of another verb (393).
  47. An infinitive with subject accusative may be used with
    verbs meaning _say_, _think_, _know_, _perceive_, and the
    like, to express an indirect statement (401).
  48. The indicative is used with *quod* in a substantive clause
    to state something which is regarded as a fact (496).

628. *Participles, the Gerund, and the Gerundive.*

  49. A participle may be used as an adjective to modify a noun;
    or it may express the idea that might otherwise be expressed
    by a clause of _time_, _concession_, _cause_, or _condition_,
    or by a _relative_ clause (443-445).
  50. The gerund is a verbal noun used in the genitive, dative,
    accusative, and ablative singular, with the constructions of
    regular nouns (461).
  51. When a gerund with an object might be used, the gerundive
    is the more usual construction. The gerundive is a verbal
    adjective in agreement with the noun (471, 472).
  52. The gerund or the gerundive with *ad* or *causā* may be
    used to express the purpose of an action (461, 472).
  53. The gerundive is used with the forms of the verb *sum* to
    express necessary action (473).

629. *Subordinate Clauses in Indirect Statements.*

  54. The verbs of the subordinate clauses of an indirect
    statement are in the subjunctive (502).



FORMATION OF LATIN WORDS

During the first year of the study of Latin the pupil should
learn the force of the prefixes and suffixes given below.

630. *Prefixes.*

  *ā- (ab-, abs-)*, _away from_, _from_
    *ab* + *dūcō* = *abdūcō*, _lead away_

  *ad-*, _to_, _toward_, _against_
    *ad* + *dūcō* = *addūcō*, _lead to_

  *con-*, _together_; _completely_
    *con* + *dūcō* = *condūcō*, _lead together_

  *dē-*, _down from_; _from_
    *dē* + *dūcō* = *dēdūcō*, _lead down_

  *ex- (ē-)*, _out from_, _out of_; _completely_
    *ē* + *dūcō* = *ēdūcō*, _lead out_

  *in-*, _in_, _into_, _on_, _toward_
    *in* + *dūcō* = *indūcō*, _lead in_, _lead on_

  *in-*, _not_; like English _un-_, _in-_
    *in* + *amīcus* = *inimīcus*, _unfriendly_

  *inter-*, _between_
    *inter* + *cēdō* = *intercēdō*, _go between_

  *per-*, _through_; _thoroughly_
    *per* + *dūcō* = *perdūcō*, _lead through_

  *prae-*, _in front of_, _in advance_
    *prae* + *mittō* = *praemittō*, _send ahead_

  *prō-*, _forward_, _forth_, _for_
    *prō* + *dūcō* = *prōdūcō*, _lead forth_

  *re- (red-)*, _back_, _again_
    *re* + *dūcō* = *redūcō*, _lead back_

  *sub- (subs-)*, _under_, _from under_, _up_
    *su(b)s* + *teneō* = *sustineō*, _hold up_, _sustain_

  *trāns- (trā-)*, _across_, _through_
    *trā* + *dūcō* = *trādūcō*, _lead across_

632. *Suffixes.*

a. The suffixes *-tās*, *-tūs*, and *-ia*, when added to the
stems of nouns, make other nouns denoting _condition_ or
_characterstic_:

  *cīvi* (stem of *cīvis*, _citizen_) + *tās* = *cīvitās*,
    _citizenship_ (the condition or characteristic of a citizen);
    _state_, _tribe_.
  *vir* (weakened stem of *vir*, _man_) + *tūs* = *virtūs*,
    _manliness_, _valor_ (the characteristic of a man).

b. The suffixes *-ia*, *-tia*, *-tās*, and *-tūdō*, when added to
the stems of adjectives, make abstract nouns denoting _quality_
or _condition_:

   *alti* (weakened stem of *altus*, _high_) + *tūdō* =
     *altitūdō*, _height_ (the quality or condition of being
     high)

c. The suffixes *-iō*, *-tiō*, *-tus*, and *-ium*, when added to
the stems of verbs, make verbal nouns denoting an _act_ or the
_result of an act_:

  *mūnī* (stem of *mūniō*, _fortify_) + *tiō* = *mūnītiō*, _a
    fortifying_, _a fortification_ (the act of fortifying, or the
    result of the act of fortifying).

633. Explain the formation of the following nouns:

  victōria    nātiō      aedificium  celeritās    dēditiō
  praemium    cōnsilium  adventus    difficultās  ēruptiō
  studium     legiō      exercitus   mūnītiō      altitūdō
  imperium    multitūdō  equitātus   praesidium   facultās
  virtūs      cīvitās    cōnspectus  subsidium    lēgātiō
  conloquium  tempestās  memoria     occāsus      condiciō



ENGLISH DERIVATIVES

634. *Suggestions for a Notebook.* In making a collection of the
English words that are derived from the Latin words of the
vocabularies, the pupil should keep the results of his work in a
notebook. Such a book should contain, in addition to the list of
derivatives, the definition of each derivative, and a brief
sentence illustrating its use. A suggested form of arrangement
for the notebook follows:

  DERIVATIVES OF *Vocō*, _call_

  *vocō, vocāre, vocāvī, vocātus*

  vocation, vocational, vocal, evoke, convoke, convocation,
    vocative, revoke, invoke, vociferous, invocation

  vocation: a _calling_, occupation
  vocational: pertaining to a vocation or _calling_
  vocal: pertaining to the voice
  evoke: _call_ out
  convoke: _call_ together
  convocation: a _calling_ together, an assembly
  vocative: case of _calling_, case of addresse
  revoke: _call_ back
  invoke: _call_ upon, ask for
  vociferous: of large _calling_ power, with a loud voice
  invocation: a _calling_ upon, a prayer

  vocation: The choice of a vocation is not always easy
  vocational: Vocational guidance is often necessary
  vocal: He is receiving vocal instruction
  evoke: His remarks evoked applause
  convoke: He will convoke the council
  convocation: Convocation day is at hand
  vocative: The vocative is not common in Cæsar
  revoke: Their punishment will be revoked
  invoke: The ancients invoked many gods
  vociferous: The audience became vociferous
  invocation: The invocation was then made

635. The following verbs are especially worthy of study in the
manner suggested above because of the large number of English
words derived from them:

  amō       dūcō               audiō    locō (conlocō)    nāvigō
  videō     mittō              dīcō     cēdō              pōnō
  habeō     capiō              vincō    parō              cognōscō
  doceō     iaciō              faciō    pugnō             putō
  moneō     sedeō (obsideō)    dō       teneō             moveō
  terreō    timeō              agō      veniō             sūmō

The prefixes listed in 630, and also *ante*, _before_, *circum*,
_around_, *ob*, _toward_, and *super*, _above_, usually are
evident in the English derivatives of Latin words. But sometimes
the prefix appears in a different spelling: thus,

  *ab-* appears as *a-*, *abs-*, *as-* (_abstain_)
  *ad-* appears as *ac-*, *ag-*, *al-*, *ap-*, *ar-*, *as-*,
    *at-* (_apparatus_)
  *con-* appears as *com-*, *co-*, *col-*, *cor-* (_composition_)
  *in-* appears as *im-*, *ir-*, *il-* (_impose_)
  *ob-* appears as *oc-*, *of-*, *obs-*, *o-* (_occur_)
  *sub-* appears as *suc-*, *suf-*, *sug-*, *sup-*, *sur-*
    (_suppose_)

LATIN-ENGLISH VOCABULARY

In this vocabulary words inclosed in brackets (except in the
case of compounds with one or both parts changed in form) are
sometimes primitives, sometimes cognates.

Translations inclosed within parentheses are not intended to
be used as such. They are inserted to show literal meanings.

Abbreviations are generally self-explanatory. Cf. (_confer_) =
compare; irr. = irregular.

Words printed in SMALL CAPITALS are at once derivatives and
definitions: as, _ABDUCT_, under *abdūcō*. Many other more or
less remotely derived words, not definitions, are added in
_italic_ in parentheses: as, (_Accident_), under *accidō*.

It will be seen that comparisons of words in reference to
meaning are much more frequent than is usual in special
vocabularies. this has been done fro mthe conviction that the
pupils should make such comparisons frequently from the
outset.
